In Taiwan’s short history as a democracy, this election was only the 7th presidential election that Taiwan has held, conducted after months of unrest in Hong Kong and an increasing trend of populism around the world. For us at <a href=\"https://international.thenewslens.com/\">the News Lens</a>, we formed a small team of designers, engineers, and editors to build <a href=\"https://international.thenewslens.com/interactive/126882\">this year’s election tracker</a>.</p><p>2020年1月11號，台灣舉辦了總統立委大選。從台灣民主化到現在的時間不長，這只是第七次總統大選。這段時期，香港正發生反送中事件，以及世界許多國家有往民粹主義發展的趨勢。我和在<a href=\"https://www.thenewslens.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">關鍵評論網</a>的厲害設計師、編輯和產品長藉著這個機會做了一個<a href=\"https://www.thenewslens.com/interactive/126883\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">特別的專題</a>。</p><h2 id=\"product\">Product</h2><h2 id=\"-\">產品規劃</h2><p>Before we started planning the technical details, we began by thinking about election coverage as a product: What do readers care about?

We knew that we wanted to display the results as close to realtime as we possible could, and knew that we wanted to cover presidential, district legislators, party legislators, and indigenous legislators. We also knew that we wanted to create an experience that gave readers content for before, during, and after the election, and to make content that could be built upon and referenced in the future.</p><p>第一個考量是我們預期 80% 的讀者會用手機看我們的開票網站，再者，雖然大部分讀者是中文使用者，但也會有英文的讀者對台灣大選有興趣。我們也知道頁面需要最即時的資訊，包含總統、分區立委、不分區立委和原住民立委。而且我們也知道給讀者的體驗不只是選舉開票的過程，在選舉之前跟之後的資訊都很重要。另外，我們也想做出一些未來還可以持續沿用的元件。這開票網站總共花了差不多兩個月的時間完整。包含的團隊主要是一位工程師和一位設計師。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt width=\"1948\" height=\"1040\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png 1948w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>To begin, we launched our election coverage by doing an aggregation of political polls in Taiwan, giving readers a more holistic view of trends of support for each of the presidential candidates. This not only gave us a way to promote our election coverage, but also gave us a way to test our new, Svelte-based system for building interactive articles and work out some of the kinks before election day. In total, building this tracker took us about two months, with a dedicated engineer and designer working nearly full time on this project.</p><p>我們首先製作的選舉專題，是台灣民意調查結果的綜合呈現，讓我們的讀者能比較完整地了解每位候選人的支持度與支持度的變化趨勢。這個民調專題不但讓我們多增加一個方式推播相關的選舉報導，也讓我們在選舉之前可以測試數位報導的新系統。（下面有補充我們用的 Svelte 框架）</p><h2 id=\"maps\">Maps</h2><h2 id=\"--1\">地圖</h2><p>Given that the main interaction users make with the election tracker is through the map, the map had to be responsive to user interaction and data updates. To allow users to explore as much of the data as possible, we decided that our map would at have three different layers to interact with.</p><p>因為我們的開票頁面中，與使用者最重要的互動是透過地圖的方式，所以我們的地圖一定要有很好的操作體驗，更新資料的反應要迅速。為了讓讀者能夠探索最大量的資料，我們決定頁面的地圖資訊需要分成三個不同層次。</p><p>The topmost layer is the whole country, including the outer islands that are part of Taiwan’s jurisdiction, followed by 22 counties (縣市). Each of the 22 counties can be further divided into towns (鄉鎮區), and the smallest unit of locality which we did not display is the village (里).</p><p>最上層是全台灣的圖層，用 22 個縣市來呈現。各個縣市的下一圖層是鄉鎮區。而我們決定不要分到里的層級，因為我們怕讀者會搞不清，現在他在哪一層。</p><p>All of this map data is obtained from <a href=\"https://data.gov.tw/dataset/7438\">Taiwan’s government website</a> in the form of a 114MB shapefile. Obviously, if we were to directly convert the shapefile to topojson (a format for browsers to draw maps, more on this later), we’d still be looking at a file that is ~90MB in size; far too big to have every user download to their device.</p><p>地圖圖資的原始檔案是<a href=\"https://data.gov.tw/dataset/7438\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">台灣政府提供的 shapefile</a>。很明顯地，如果我們直接把這個檔案轉到 topojson 給 D3 畫地圖，檔案大小大約 90 MB，這麼大的檔案會下載太久，也會影響網站呈現的效能。</p><p>Moreover, the map needs to be processed for special areas (areas that are part of Taiwan’s jurisdiction but may not be part of an official locality, such as 釣魚台) and relocation of the outer islands so that Kinmen and Lienchiang don’t make the map look too big. At first, I processed a few topojson files using QGIS and the shapefile obtained from the government, but after many failed attempts, (ie incorrect island relocation, missing districts, resulting file too large, too many details removed from the map during compression, etc) I decided to create an API endpoint that would process the map that I want on the fly.</p><p>還有一個考量是我們的地圖必須把特殊的地區整理出來，有一些屬於台灣控制但被管制沒有人居住的地方，例如釣魚台。地圖還需要把金門和連江移到離本島近一點，不然台灣地圖中間都會是海。一開始的時候，我手動用 QGIS 產生一些 topojson 的檔案，但因為每次做的都有一點不對（外島移的地方不太對、地區不對、檔案還是太大、壓縮的太過度等等），最後我決定用程式依據設定即時產生 topojson 地圖。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Dynamic Map Code\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-8.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-8.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-8.png 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-8.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In essence, the API endpoint takes a few parameters:</p><ul><li>Map Version: Due to the fact that these borders will change based on redistricting or otherwise, I wanted to future-proof this API by allowing future maps to be easily versioned by year.</li><li>Locality Depth: Do we want the borders of the county, town, village, or district?</li><li>Specific Locality: Do we want the borders of a specific county, town, village, or district?</li><li>Simplification Level: How simplified do we want the resulting JSON file to be? More simplification and quantization means smaller file sizes but also a loss of detail.</li><li>Condensation of Outer Islands: Do we want a map where Kinmen and Lienchiang are where they are geographically or do we want to see them closer to mainland Taiwan?</li></ul><p>基本上，這個 API 有幾個設定：</p><ul><li>地圖版本：因為台灣地區的邊界是變動的，我的系統必須能按照年度去抓不一樣的地圖。</li><li>地區層級：我們的地圖要縣市、鄉鎮、里還是選區的邊界線？</li><li>特定的地區：我們只要某一個地區的地圖嗎？</li><li>壓縮程度：我們想要把地圖簡化和壓縮到什麼程度？雖然簡化會產出更小的檔案，但地圖細節也會相對變少。</li><li>外島移動：我們要不要把金門和連江移到比較靠近本島的地方？</li></ul><p>However, because legislative districts are not exactly correlated to any one of the existing locales, we had to separately process all of the locales of each of the legislative districts. Because a whole day of searching could not turn up a shapefile for Taiwan’s legislative districts, we decided to create the map ourselves based on which counties, towns, or villages, belonged to which district.</p><p>然而，因為區域立委的選區劃分跟我們上面提的地圖地區不一樣，所以我們需要額外去處理選區的地圖圖層。在政府的網站找了老半天，都沒找到選區的地圖，所以就只好自己依據中選會公布的選區劃分資料來做一個選區的地圖。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Custom Map Making\" width=\"2150\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-3.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-3.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-3.png 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-3.png 2150w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"svg-vs-canvas\">SVG vs Canvas</h3><h3 id=\"-svg-canvas-\">必須考慮 SVG 的缺點， Canvas 的優點</h3><p>After constructing a reliable way to generate our topojson, the next question was figuring out how to display it in our browser. The naive approach is to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-1-897aa8f8ca2c\">simply render the topojson to a SVG</a>. However, the problem with this is that SVGs use the DOM, which means that changes or user interactions with a complex SVG is slow and resource intensive. Add locale labels and mouse interactions and suddenly your SVG implementation slows to a crawl.</p><p>做完我們產生地圖的方式之後，我們下一個問題是怎麼顯示到瀏覽器裡。其實如果很<a href=\"https://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-1-897aa8f8ca2c\" rel=\"noopener\">單純得把 topojson 直接用 D3 顯示 SVG 是很容易</a>，但用 SVG 對效能不是很好。因為 SVG 用的是瀏覽器的 DOM，這變成每次跟地圖互動或者更新資料時，都要用 DOM 去更新。再加上地區的標籤與滑鼠的互動，網頁就會突然變得很慢。</p><p>The alternative is to use a canvas for display and an invisible SVG for interaction. This allows us to avoid expensive DOM operations of maintaining and manipulating the color of each locale on the map and instead use the canvas API to paint our map, while maintaining a SVG just to keep track of when users interact. In my very unscientific benchmarking on my own machine, I found that SVGs needed to be about twice a simplified compared to canvas in order to achieve similar performance. More about <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@rdmurphy/combining-html-canvas-svg-flatbush-for-super-efficient-hov\">this method here</a>.</p><p>效能比較好的作法是用 canvas 顯示，但用 SVG 接互動的事件。這個做法可以避免 DOM 因為計算每一個不同地區的顏色和位置而變慢。大略的實驗之後，我發現用這種做法大約可以提昇兩倍的效能。如果想要更深入了解這個做法，<a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@rdmurphy/combining-html-canvas-svg-flatbush-for-super-efficient-hov\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">可以參考這個教學</a>。</p><p>The optimizations that I could have done on the map are endless. If we were to further optimize the map, I would recommend using some kind of WebGL implementation, potentially <a href=\"https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/\">MapboxGL</a> to make map rendering performance even better, but a canvas approach was good enough for this use case.</p><p>如果還有更多的時間，其實還可以繼續地優化我們的地圖，例如使用一種 WebGL 的套件、<a href=\"https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">MapboxGL</a> 等等，但我覺得這個專題用 Canvas 就夠好了。</p><h2 id=\"data-pipeline\">Data Pipeline</h2><h2 id=\"--2\">資料流程</h2><p>The data for our election tracker was obtained from the Central Election Committee, which gives us a 3MB JSON file of all the data anytime it is updated. Because this JSON file is so large and can take up to 5 seconds to download from the Central Election Committee, we decided to only fetch it at a regular cadence and process / store it into a database we can control and scale.</p><p>因為我們的資料來源是中選會，每次串入的資料是一個 3MB 的 JSON 檔案。因為檔案尺寸這麼大，有時候會需要到五秒的時間才能完成下載，所以我們決定用 cronjob 一分鐘取一次，然後存在我們自己的資料庫裡（Google Datastore）。這樣我們才比較能應對網站的高流量。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Data Pipeline\" width=\"2650\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-9.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-9.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-9.png 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/Artboard-9.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>To do this, we used a cron job that would fetch the latest data from the Central Election Committee every minute, and separate out presidential and legislative results before storing it into Google Datastore.</p><p>然後為了讓編輯們能加上當選註記，我們開了一個 Google Spreadsheet 讓編輯填寫。這個 Spreadsheet 直接連到我們的系統。這個做法後來有出問題，我會在下面一段解釋。</p><p>Then, in order to indicate when a candidate has won, we connected a Google Spreadsheet that allowed our editors to manually mark when a race had been won. The system would then use that data to display the winner on the frontend. As it turns out, this became a problem on the night of the election, which I expand more on in the “lessons learned” section.</p><h2 id=\"election-rules-edge-cases\">Election Rules Edge Cases</h2><h2 id=\"--3\">選舉規則特殊狀況</h2><p>In terms of electoral rules, Taiwan follows a simple majority-wins policy for electing it’s president, which is easy to display on a map. However, legislative races follow a fairly complex system:</p><ul><li>Taiwan’s legislature has a total of 113 seats.</li><li>73 district legislators are elected through a majority-wins policy for each of the 73 designated districts of Taiwan.</li><li>34 party legislators are elected through a party-vote system, in which voters vote on a party, and all parties that obtain over 5% of the overall vote get to assign legislators based on the proportion of votes they receive. The legislators of a party elected through this system must be &gt;50% female, according to the order they are ranked in their party list.</li><li>6 indigenous legislators are elected by two three-member constituencies, picking the top three legislators for each plains and highlands indigenous constituencies.</li></ul><p>台灣選總統是最高票數的候選人贏，這種規則很容易被顯示在地圖上。但是，選立委的規則很複雜，要用地圖呈現是一個蠻大的挑戰：</p><ul><li>台灣立委總共有 113 席。</li><li>73 席是分區立委，總共有 73 選區選出各個選區的最高票數候選人。</li><li>34 席是不分區立委，投給各個政黨。政黨票超過總票數 5% 的政黨，會按照比例去分配這 34 席。但是用這個方法選上的候選人，有女性保證名額，必須超過50% 是女性。</li><li>6 席的原住民立委中，3 席給山地原住民，3 席給平地原住民。</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-6.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-6.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-6.png 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-6.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This logic poses a few challenges. First of all, the topmost level we can display for district legislators is the district itself, because we can’t calculate the color for a county that has multiple districts with different races.</p><p>這些邏輯要怎麼呈現呢？首先，分區立委能夠呈現的最高層不是縣市，因為一個縣市如果有多個選區，你沒辦法在無關的選區選出哪一個政黨領先，所以最高層只能顯示各個選區的地圖。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-5.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-5.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-5.png 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-5.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Second, because indigenous legislature races elect the top three candidates for each plains and highlands indigenous groups, simply coloring a district with the party of the first-place candidate does not reflect the true breakdown of the vote. Thus, we decided to take the top three candidates and add up the votes based on their political parties, then take the color of the party with the most votes.</p><p>第二，因為原住民立委是山地和平地各選出最高票的三位，我們不能直接用最高票的候選人去呈現一個地區，因為這不見得真正代表一個選區的支持。我們討論到後來決定把前三高票按照政黨加起來，然後再選最高票政黨的顏色去呈現。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-4.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-4.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-4.png 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-4.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Third, because of the gender rule for party votes, legislators of a party that get elected through this method do not necessarily correspond with the order that they are placed in the party list. As a result, we have to build an algorithm to determine skip over the next male legislator in the list if there are already too many men.</p><p>第三，因為不分區立委有女性保證名額，每個政黨所排得不分區席次順序，不一定是選上席次的順序。因此，我們再特別寫一個邏輯來判斷什麼時候需要跳過男性的立委，以滿足因為那個政黨選上的女性比例。</p><h2 id=\"post-election-graphics\">Post-Election Graphics</h2><h2 id=\"--4\">選後圖表</h2><p>Another large element of our election coverage was the graphics that we post to social media such as Facebook and Instagram. Because we wanted to be able to generate social media optimized graphics as fast as possible, we needed a method faster than designers plugging in election results into graphic. To achieve this, we built an internal website that would dynamically generate SVGs with the latest data from the Central Election Committee.</p><p>我們選舉專題另外一個很大的部分是要提供在網站、FB 和 IG 要發布的圖表。如果等到選舉之後才請設計師出資訊圖表，他們一定會做得又趕又累。因此，我們寫了一個內部用的網站，可以即時用中選會的資料產生他們事先設計好的圖表。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Dynamic Graphic Generation\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-7.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-7.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-7.png 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-7.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>To achieve this, designers would first come up with the design of the graphics in the form of an adobe illustrator document. Then we took those graphics and exported each one into a separate SVG. Because SVG files are a XML-based specification, we can port these into our web application in order to make content within the SVG dynamic.</p><p>我們的流程是先把設計師設計的圖表輸出成 SVG。因為 SVG 只是一個 XML 類型的檔案，我們可以很容易用網頁框架動態地產生 SVG。用 SVG 這樣操作的好處是用什麼程式語言或框架都可以。在我們的用途中，是將產出的 SVG 設定為可以下載成 SVG 以及PNG 兩種檔案。</p><p>The great thing about using SVGs in this way is that it is language and tool agnostic, which means you can use whatever existing templating language / framework you use to generate these graphics. In our case, we fitted it into an internal website that the social media team can directly access to download the generated SVG or a PNG format to be posted on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.</p><h2 id=\"monitoring\">Monitoring</h2><h2 id=\"--5\">系統監控</h2><p>Another critical piece of election-preparedness was making sure that we knew everything that was happening with our web application at all times. To monitor the health of the application and make sure that everything scaled properly, we set up a grafana dashboard that kept track of server errors, response latency, upstream API connections, cache hit ratios, as well as the standard CPU, memory, and database metrics.</p><p>另一個很重要的準備是確定我們隨時都能知道系統健不健康，這樣我們才能夠在出事時，有更快的反應。為了系統監控，我們在 Kubernetes Cluster 上運用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 紀錄錯誤、回答速度、往外連線、cache hit 率和比較基本的 CPU、memory 和 DB 等等的資訊。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Grafana Monitoring\" width=\"1919\" height=\"938\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg 1919w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>By having the web application directly report metrics to prometheus, it was much easier to get the fine grained metrics specific to elections that we cared about. Because we had taken the time to integrate key metrics into prometheus, when errors began to show up during the election, we were able to immediately know what was causing the error.</p><p>把 prometheus 的資訊套在程式上可以比較容易監控一些客製化的資訊。選舉當天 Google spreadsheet 出問題的時候，我們因為有套 prometheus ，所以馬上就知道是 Google 那邊的問題。</p><h2 id=\"svelte\">Svelte</h2><h2 id=\"--6\">紐約時報開發的前端框架</h2><p>Although React has been possibly the most popular front-end framework to use these days, one of the questions I find interesting to ask during interviews is “Under what circumstances is React not a good framework to use? When would you recommend not using React?” This is a question that stumps many less-experienced engineers and people without a good grasp of what React really does in the browser under the hood. In fact, I believe that there are many situations under which React is not a good choice, and building interactives in a news environment is one of them.</p><p>最近在前端工程師的世界裡 React 變得很紅，但我最近常常很喜歡問的問題是「怎麼樣的狀況之下你覺得 React 不適合？什麼時候會建議不要用 React 開發一個專案？」這是一個需要比較有經驗的前端工程師才能回答的問題。我認為有很多狀況下 React 不適合。而媒體的特殊數位報導就是其中一個。</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/svelte.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt width=\"712\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/svelte.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/svelte.png 712w\"></figure><p>News organizations have a very different development and deployment cycle than tech companies do, requiring tighter deadlines, faster feedback loops, and more bespoke flexibility.

Using Sapper with Svelte would also allow me to write the server-side data APIs quickly and easily.</li><li>Bundled JS Size: Because Svelte runs as a compiler, it’s able to build and include only the code that your applications needs, making the compiled bundle much smaller than a React application.</li></ul><p>新聞對數位報導的開發需求，需要更優雅的程式設計去即時地傳遞與回應訊息，這是一件非常有挑戰性的事情。因此，我這次開發即時開票頁面使用的框架是 <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Svelte</a>。為什麼要選擇用 Svelte，它有哪裡比 React 好？</p><ul><li>開發速度。Svelte 大致上比 React 要寫的程式碼少 ～30%。這個聽起來可能沒有很多，但 30% 的差別也代表 30% 的效率。</li><li>程式大小。因為 Svelte 是一個 Compiler，最終寫完的程式碼檔案很小，因為他只會打包你的程式所需要的東西。</li></ul><p>If you’re interested in learning more about Svelte, there are many <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics\">tutorials to help you get started</a>.</p><p>如果你有興趣學 Svelte，這裏<a href=\"https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">有很多</a>可以參考的教學。</p><h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</h2><h2 id=\"--7\">學到的心得</h2><h3 id=\"load-test\">Load Test</h3><h3 id=\"--8\">壓力測試</h3><p>The biggest problem we saw on election night was that the site was down for ~1 hour due to high traffic. Specifically, it wasn’t the servers on our end that could not take the traffic, it was our usage of Google Sheets that caused Google to lock our google spreadsheet when the flow of traffic became too large. After Google locked out requests to the spreadsheet, our system started responding to downstream users with 500 errors, causing the entire site to be inoperable.</p><p>我們在選舉當天遇到關鍵評論網的最高流量。這個高流量造成網站有差不多一小時的時間沒辦法使用。而問題是出在我們打 Google Spreadsheets 的流量太高，導致 Google 把我們的 Spreadsheet 封鎖，所以我們的 API 一開始有很大量的錯誤訊息。</p><p>The solution was to first disconnect the spreadsheet from our services, which brought both our service and the google spreadsheet back online. Then, we implemented a quick function that would prevent the service from requesting data from the google spreadsheet so often. This brought everything back online.</p><p>排除這個問題的第一步，是把我們系統跟 Google Spreadsheet 的連線斷開，讓 Google Spreadsheet 回復到正常。接下來，我們加了一個很簡單的邏輯，讓我們的程式不要那麼常去打 Google Spreadsheet。這個作法使我們的系統回復到正常狀態。</p><p>The lesson here is that, unless you fully load test your entire system before the election, you never know what problems will be caused when traffic increases by a few orders of magnitude. Often, third-party services such as Google Docs will have their own unwritten throughput and bandwidth limits.</p><p>這個事件讓我們學到的是，你永遠不知道高流量可能會造成什麼樣的問題，而你也需要完整地做一個壓力測試，你才能知道第三方服務會有可能出現什麼樣的問題。</p><h3 id=\"have-a-clear-incident-response-plan\">Have a Clear Incident Response Plan</h3><h3 id=\"--9\">規劃一個明確的反應流程</h3><p>No matter how much planning you do in preparation of the big day, incidents are always likely to happen and things will never go exactly according to plan. That said, after you’ve made all the preparation you can possibly make, the next important thing to plan for is how to respond when things do not go as plan. In our case, by dividing up responsibilities we had a basic level of responsibilities when things went awry, but it would have been more advantageous to rehearse a few scenarios.</p><p>不論你做了多少準備，當下發生的事情通常都會跟你預設的不一樣。這代表你做完所有能夠想像的情況準備之後，你還要預設一個當事件發生時的反應流程。這個流程包含跑一些練習，預設誰負責溝通，誰負責修問題。這兩個角色一定需要準備，因為修問題的人需要專心的修問題，沒辦法同時跟大家回報現在的狀況。</p><p>Namely, when the site goes down, it is important to define who will fix the problem and who will report the status to the rest of the team. It is hard for one person to do both, lest the person trying to fix the problem becomes bombarded with too many inquiries about the current status and is unable to concentrate on fixing the problem.</p><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2><h2 id=\"--10\">專案結論</h2><p>In conclusion, I hope the process we used and the lessons we learned can be built upon by the community, allowing future elections and similar events to be faster, more efficient, and better experiences for our readers and our organizations. I’m sure that our processes will continue to evolve, and I hope we can continue to learn better workflows and collaboration processes.</p><p>我希望我們在關鍵評論遇到的經驗可以幫助大家的思考，讓以後的選舉我們都可以給讀者更好的閱讀體驗。我也希望我們的流程會不斷的進步，讓我們能繼續分享我們學到的東西。</p>","comment_id":"5f33f347f4c9bc65cca4be60","feature_image":"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-1.png","featured":false,"status":"published","visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-08-12T13:48:55.000Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T15:32:55.000Z","published_at":"2020-01-29T05:18:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"On January 11th, 2020, Taiwan went to the polls to elect their next President and Legislature.

We all have our vices – mine include the lamb dumplings from Tianjin Dumpling House, which I’ve always kept a bag of sitting in my freezer. They’re plump, juicy, thicc, and life-changing.</p><p>New York City. A city that has attracted immigrants from around the world for a million different reasons, where a cacophony of languages, cultures, and experiences harmonize. Flushing represents an experience of Asian-America that shares cultural roots yet is different in every other way from my hometown of Cupertino. As I’ve gotten to know Asian-Americans who grew up in Queens, our conversations have uncovered stories of children who had to translate for their parents at a young age or hide in work closets because there wasn’t enough money for childcare.</p><p>My grandparents came to the United States with roughly enough money to buy a dining table and a TV, stopping in Flushing for less than a year before moving to Houston where they live today. In a recent conversation with my grandma, she told me about the restaurant on Main Street where she would buy roast duck during the first six months they spent in the States as they learned English. Today, scenes of the immigrant work ethic are still visible in Flushing, where new immigrants continue to live the life that my grandparents experienced thirty years ago.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt width=\"4048\" height=\"3036\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Down the little alley known as 40th Road is Shanghai You Garden, where they make soup dumplings by hand in the front of the restaurant for all to see, reminding me of Taiwan’s legendary Din Tai Fung. Walk a few doors down and you’ll find Yifang Taiwan Fruit Tea, a gem of Taiwan’s most notorious culinary export: boba.</p><p>There’s no contest when it comes to two types of foods that I will never tire of: noodles and tacos. Despite what the average New Yorker may believe, New York City is a medieval backwater when it comes to tacos – sure you have Los Tacos #1, but anyone who’s had any random taco truck in Los Angeles can tell you that Los Tacos is merely passable in comparison. When it comes to noodles, however, New York’s got an endless variety: Singapore Laksa, Khao Soy, Beef Noodle Soup, Bun Bo Hue, Biang Biang Noodles from places like Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles, Taste Good Malaysian Cuisine, Dun Huang Beef Noodle, and so on.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt width=\"4048\" height=\"2544\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>It’s been almost three months since I’ve left New York City, but I still get flashbacks of the anticipation on 7 train between Mets-Willets Point and Flushing Main St. Or the time that, upon finishing an episode of Parts Unknown at 11pm, my friend and I ventured into the cold for the same living octopus that we just watched Bourdain eat on TV. I’ve tried so many new cuisines in New York City – Sichuan, Colombian, Greek, Uyghur, Tibetan, Brazilian, Malaysian, all without venturing more than a few subway stops from my apartment in Queens.</p><p>I’d love to say that every place I’ve tried in New York has been nothing short of stellar, but the reality is quite the opposite: for every place that has left me with a new appreciation for a certain type of noodle, meat, or vegetable, many others have left me disappointed or unsatisfied. I’ll never understand why New York City has a disproportionately high number of mediocre and expensive ramen restaurants, or the poke shops that are more pleasing to the instagram than the taste buds.</p><p>I think back on it now with a kind of nostalgic Stockholm Syndrome. Faded are the irritations of getting to see sunlight for mere minutes everyday, fighting for personal space on a subway train with a broken AC, and the city noises that never shut up. These days, I’m soaking up all California has to offer by wandering through the desert, the forest, the mountains, or the beaches, wondering how I ever was able to function in such an excessive concrete jungle. The food certainly made it more stomachable.</p>","comment_id":"5f4b7745678061fcf00a2e8c","feature_image":"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/DSC00224.jpg","featured":false,"status":"published","visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-08-30T09:54:13.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T10:03:47.000Z","published_at":"2019-03-08T09:54:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Next to a stand of dragonfruit, durian, guavas, lychee, and mangosteen on the corner of Main Street and 41st Rd, a nondescript door presents itself in a drab, frosted white.

The results came as a surprise to many people, even those who already expected this election to be a rebuke to president Tsai Ing-Wen's (蔡英文) two years in power. On the ballot were the mayors for all cities in Taiwan, thousands of councillors, local representatives, and ten referendum questions.</p><p>The shift in power back toward the KMT was not the only thing that indicated a mobilization of more conservative voters. Every single referendum question that progressives rallied behind was voted down, including questions supporting marriage equality and a participation in the Olympics as Taiwan instead of Chinese Taipei.</p><p>Now that the election has happened, let's dive into the data to get a better picture of what actually happened and what this means for Taiwan and the world.</p><h2 id=\"mayoral-elections\">Mayoral Elections</h2><p>To begin, let's start by taking a look at the mayoral elections across the country. Taiwan's mayoral elections are closely watched as they are considered to be similar in importance to a gubernatorial election in the US.</p><p><em>(Hover over a district to explore. Blue districts indicate a KMT mayoral victory, green districts indicate a DPP mayoral victory, and grey districts indicate a third party mayoral victory. Striped districts indicate a change in party from the 2014 election.)</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"taiwan extended\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\";\nimport define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3\";\n(new Runtime).module(define, name => {\n  if (name === \"taiwan\") return Inspector.into(\".taiwan\")();\n});\n</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The first thing that is made apparent in this map is how much blue there is. But as is with any election map, geographical space is an inaccurate representation of population. That is to say that much of the central and eastern areas of Taiwan are sparsely populated.</p><p>However, closer inspection of the map reveals a few interesting points. First, there are far more blue striped districts than green striped districts, indicating that while many districts in Taichung (台中) and Kaohsiung (高雄) flipped blue, some districts in Taoyuan (桃園) actually flipped green. Hualien (花蓮) county is striped because it went from an independent county mayor to a KMT one. That Taichung flipped back to blue is no surprised, as Taichung is historically more blue than green.</p><h2 id=\"kaohsiung-\">Kaohsiung (高雄)</h2><p>Perhaps the most closely watched mayoral election of the night was that of the city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city. In all of Taiwan's history as a two party democracy, Kaohsiung has consistently and reliably been under control of the DPP, making this year's KMT victory for Han Kuo-Yu (韓國瑜) a major surprise.</p><p>By all counts, Han Kuo-Yu was a candidate that came out of relative obscurity into the public spotlight as he campaigned to become Kaohsiung's mayor. He is a second-generation \"mainlander\" (a group that arrived in Taiwan during China's civil war) from New Taipei City (新北市) on the north end of Taiwan.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"kaohsiung extended\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\";\nimport define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3\";\n(new Runtime).module(define, name => {\n  if (name === \"kaohsiung\") return Inspector.into(\".kaohsiung\")();\n});\n</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As we can see in this map, Han Kuo-Yu successfully flipped a large majority of the districts in Kaohsiung, giving him the nickname \"han wave\" (寒流, or maybe 韓流).</p><h2 id=\"taipei-\">Taipei (台北)</h2><p>Taipei was another closely watched election for a separate reason. Similar to Han Kuo-Yu's victory in Kaohsiung, Ko Wen-Jie (柯文哲) shocked the nation when he won the mayor's election in Taipei in 2014. Despite the apparent similarities between Ko Wen-Jie and Han Kuo-Yu, Ko is notable additionally for being the first to win an election as Taipei's mayor as an independent.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"taipei extended\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\";\nimport define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3\";\n(new Runtime).module(define, name => {\n  if (name === \"taipei\") return Inspector.into(\".taipei\")();\n});\n</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this year's election, Ko was reelected by less than 3,000 votes, leaving the election much closer than most people expected. A likely explanation for this is that in 2014 Ko received endorsement from the DPP, who did not put a candidate into the race. But in 2018, unhappy with Ko in his first term, the DPP ran Pasuya Yao (姚文智) as a protest against Ko, likely cannibalizing his votes.</p><h2 id=\"referendum-questions\">Referendum Questions</h2><p>On the ballot this year were also ten referendum questions. The current manifestation of referendum system was created legislatively in December of 2017 by the DPP, making the barrier of entry to citizens directly running referendums much easier by lowering the threshold for submitting. Interestingly, the decreased barrier of entry to running a referendum likely backfired politically on the DPP, with all of the positions supported by conservatives passing, while none of the positions supported by progressives passed.</p><p><em>(Hover over each map to see the question and the voting results. Yellow districts indicate a majority \"yes\" vote and red districts indicate a majority \"no\" vote)</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"referendum extended\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\";\nimport define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3\";\n(new Runtime).module(define, name => {\n  if (name === \"referendum\") return Inspector.into(\".referendum\")();\n});\n</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Looking at the data, it's apparent that most referendum questions went nearly unanimously yes or no, with question number 13 regarding the olympics causing the closest vote.</p><blockquote>Do you agree to the use of “Taiwan” when participating in all international sport competitions, including the upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics?</blockquote><p>If we take a closer look at the way that people voted on this question, you'll notice that the \"yes\" votes seem to cluster around Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Yilan. Despite the fact that large amounts of the electorate in Kaohsiung turned out in support of the KMT candidate Han Kuo-Yu, it appears that many of them still voted for referendum question 13. One way to interpret this may not be that perspectives in Kaohsiung are becoming more favorable of KMT causes, but that Han Kuo-Yu's populist approach successfully motivated the city.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"referendum13 extended\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\";\nimport define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3\";\n(new Runtime).module(define, name => {\n  if (name === \"referendum13\") return Inspector.into(\".referendum13\")();\n});\n</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"turnout\">Turnout</h2><p>Another very interesting factor to consider is how people turned out. There are many similarities between the 2014 local election and the recent 2018 local election. Just as the results of the 2018 election are seen as a backlash to Tsai Ing-Wen, the results of 2014 election can similarly be considered a backlash to the previous president Ma Ying-Jeou (馬英九). Although the overall voter turnout in this election was higher than 2014, it is apparent that different districts turned out differently.</p><p><em>(Purple districts indicate an increase in voter turnout compared to 2014, and red districts indicate a decrease in voter turnout. Voter turnout in this section is calculated by votes for mayor in 2014 and 2018)</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"turnout extended\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\";\nimport define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3\";\n(new Runtime).module(define, name => {\n  if (name === \"turnout\") return Inspector.into(\".turnout\")();\n});\n</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We can look at this graph as an indication of who turned out in each election. Across the board, turnout was lower in Taipei, Tainan, and Taichung, while higher in Kaohsiung. As discussed above, we saw an increase in turnout in Kaohsiung likely because of Han Kuo-Yu.</p><p>Overall, 12,507,779 people voted in 2018 compared to 12,261,784 people in 2014. The increased turnout was most apparent in Kaohsiung and New Taipei City. Here's another way to look at this data.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"turnoutGraph extended\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\";\nimport define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3\";\n(new Runtime).module(define, name => {\n  if (name === \"turnoutGraph\") return Inspector.into(\".turnoutGraph\")();\n});\n</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Despite voter turnout being higher in aggregate, we notice that voter turnout decreased in the capital city of Taipei. One explanation of lower turnout in Taipei was that this year's ballot took longer to fill out and Taipei precincts were flooded with voters, the majority of whom waited hours in order to vote. The increased waiting time was likely a deterrent for individuals who were unable to wait that long.</p><p>Returning to the referendum results, it's also plausible that the way districts turned out caused the referendum questions to lean more conservative. The fact that many of the urban cores (except for Kaohsiung) saw a decrease in turnout likely contributes to this result.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>There's no doubt that Taiwan is a vibrant, dynamic, and messy democracy. Under the looming threat of Chinese annexation, Taiwan remains fervently committed to its democracy in stark contrast to its authoritarian neighbor across the strait. Just like democracies anywhere in the world, electorates are never a monolith. There are nuances within nuances of individual politics, and explorations like these only begin to scratch the surface.</p><h2 id=\"notes\">Notes</h2><p>Voting results data fetched from the <a href=\"http://vote.2018.nat.gov.tw/pc/zh_TW/index.html\">Central Election Committee</a>.

But in a recent conversation with a startup founder, he suggested that it could also be interpreted to include digital encryption as a kind of modern weapon for self defense.</p><p>I’m no lawyer or constitutional historian, but even if that snippet of legalese cannot be stretched to protect privacy via methods of digital encryption, the thought illustrates how far we’ve come from the world that the framers of the constitution imagined while writing the initial governance for our country. The regulatory debates of our current social-political landscapes would fly over the heads of even the most forward-thinking founding fathers.</p><p>The freedom of assembly, listed right next to freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the First Amendment, is a provision guaranteed by our nation that protects the right of individuals to peacefully assemble for any reason or circumstance. Throughout America’s history, grassroots assembly has empowered individuals to organize and protest, enabling much of the change that has happened in American history.</p><p>Today, digital communications has become the medium for much of the organizing that formerly took place by physical assembly, stretching the concept of assembly beyond merely physical convenings. In this world, encryption becomes a vital part of giving people the ability to speak freely. In that sense, I’d argue that encryption has more to do with the First Amendment than the second, despite encryption not being mentioned anywhere in the original constitution.</p><p>It is this type of modern refactoring that lends itself to a constant need to rethink and refine our systems of government, technology, and social relations. But while every era presents a different set of complex challenges, it would be naive to assert that this notion of political change is new or uniquely of our time. From the renaissance to global colonization to world wars to the internet and every little thing in between, people have debated the very nature of how political and regulatory systems have functioned in a way that I will call “technocratic political innovation”.</p><p>By “technocratic”, I don’t mean someone who is leading with the intent of increasing the implementation of digital devices and systems, I mean someone with a scientific, quantitative, and research driven approach to improve outcomes in a political system. In this sense, thinkers like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">de Tocqueville</a> could potentially be considered technocratic, even if they would call a modern smartphone some kind of witchcraft.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/1318034247206.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Arab Spring\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/1318034247206.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/1318034247206.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/1318034247206.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>There’s no doubt that technology is a powerful tool for organizing and taking action. We’ve seen how things like social media and digital communications have been critical infrastructure in instances such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">widely hailed Arab Spring</a>. If we’re not careful, however, it’s easy to give too much credit to social media for the success of political movements that resulted from hundreds of thousands of people organizing and establishing their movement. And as much as social media has the power to unite, it has in certain cases also isolated us from the very movements we seek to partake in. Social media accelerates globalization in a way that connects me to similar people around the world while distancing me from the waiter at the restaurant I had lunch at.</p><p>Faulting social media platforms for ignorant bubbles isn’t entirely fair. People lived in filter bubbles long before the internet ever existed. However, social media is causing an upheaval in the way our filter bubbles operate without explicitly intending to.</p><blockquote>If social media unintentionally reconfigured our filter bubbles to break down physical distance at the expense of increasing digital distance, civic media is an intentional effort to counteract the growing distance between people.</blockquote><p>All over the world, pockets of people are prototyping new ways of digital civic participation in hopes to be successful enough to scale across an entire party, city, or a nation. The term hacktivism has been recently popularized to describe this sort of activism, across a spectrum from anonymous digital vigilantes to publicly-funded digital governance efforts. While hacktivists around the world may not be of the same political leanings, languages, or belief systems, hacktivism is a force that is only increasing in use internationally, and choosing to ignore these movements is choosing to ignore an increasingly potent force in global politics.</p><p>The drastic changes in technology and media are only going to amplify and accelerate the pace of change in our modern political establishment, propelling us into more global uncertainty. With the election of Donald Trump and populists around the world, not only are traditional politicians likely an endangered class of individuals, an even stronger wave of Millennials and Gen-Zers are waiting to one day inherit the power from today’s leaders.</p><p>It is a very crucial time in world history, and the stories of decisions made by tomorrow’s leaders today are going to have a greater impact than the decisions of today’s leaders today. <a href=\"http://www.ianbremmer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ian Bremmer</a> talks about 2016 being a transition between a world led by the United States known as <a href=\"https://www.eurasiagroup.net/live-post/it-really-is-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Pax Americana” to being a world without a clear leader known as “G-Zero”</a>.</p><p>In a G-Zero world, no country or group of countries has the leverage to unilaterally champion a single worldview. In fact, a G-Zero world means that no two countries are on the same page in terms of economic, domestic, or foreign policy, leaving the world without a country that is able to advance a specific international agenda. And as the result of globalization, corporations are sitting on greater vaults of wealth, routing assets and finances through many countries with conflicting interests, causing certain countries that would otherwise be in stark conflicts to have a somewhat stable relationship.</p><p>One argument to explain why the European Union has been relatively free of conflict in the past few decades can be attributed to the EU, specifically the way that the euro has bound the european countries together economically. A similar argument could be made about the US and China: that the two countries are so interdependent that neither side is willing to risk a conflict for fear of repercussions in their own country.</p><p>However, the economics are not enough to prevent tensions between countries. As tensions continue to escalate both between and within countries, causing democratic upheavals such as the massive protests that are taking place in response to Trump’s election in the US, Park’s impeachment in South Korea, Erdogan’s eroding of democratic systems, history tells us that we have the conditions for significant changes likely started from single individuals or group of individuals.</p><p>But despite the fact that we’re currently witnessing an alarming number of nationalistic world leaders rise to power, people today are better prepared to face these leaders than we have ever been.</p><h2 id=\"the-historical-rise-of-non-state-actors\">The Historical Rise of Non-State Actors</h2><p>The role of everyday individuals shaping the political direction runs in parallel with the technologies that everyday people have access to. Technology enables or inhibits the way that ideas are shared and movements are organized. Thus, to think that media and technology are separate is misguided; technology has always been about media, whether that be distributing an idea to as many people as possible or intentionally anonymizing and limiting who knows about something.</p><p>In 1969, an employee of RAND corporation named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Daniel Ellsberg</a> began making covert photocopies of classified documents about the Vietnam war. Being in an era before files were edited digitally, it took over the span of a year for Ellsberg to manually make copies of the documents in his off-work hours. As the news broke on June 13th, 1971, the story confirmed the suspicions people had that the government was more involved in Vietnam than they were publicly admitting.</p><p>Fast forward 40 years later, an intelligence analyst named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bradley Manning</a> was faced with a similar choice that Ellsberg faced: whether to leak documents that detailed US involvement abroad. However, the stark difference between Ellsberg and Manning was that it took Manning less than a day to copy out an archive of data hundreds of times larger than the Pentagon Papers, a cache that would have taken Ellsberg roughly 18 years to copy the way he copied the Pentagon Papers.</p><blockquote>Publishing, leaking, and whistleblowing have all become much more accessible from the time of the printing press to the internet, enabling anyone today to use cryptography and internet anonymity tools to avoid surveillance and sound the alarms on governments. Individuals such as Julian Assange can single-handedly create political nightmares for governments, forcing them to be accountable in public to the things they said privately.</blockquote><p>And Internet whistleblowing is just one example of how a small group of people are changing the way that governments and politicians operate. Just as the rise of internet media has caused print newspapers and journalists to completely change the way that they operate, it is also forcing groups to change of how they establish influence and power.</p><p>One of the most widely cited examples of the Internet’s role in political organizing has been the Arab Spring; where protests organized largely through digital tools radically impacted the relationship governments had with their citizens, including overthrowing leaders and other incumbent regimes. But around the world, the Arab Spring is only one example of how technology is being used by individuals to circulate ideas and incite political action.</p><h1 id=\"partido-de-la-red-democracyos-and-argentina\"><strong><strong>Partido de la Red, DemocracyOS, and Argentina</strong></strong></h1><p>The Outerlands was just the kind of restaurant you’d expect to find in San Francisco. The decor consists of reclaimed wood and bare lightbulbs hanging in a way that is most-definitely more expensive than appears. Here, founders from all over the world are attracted to the prospect of starting their own technology company and achieve the now-cliche belief that they are “changing the world”.</p><p>Wearing a hoodie that is typical for Silicon Valley technology types, Santiago walked in after a morning of wrangling code for his new internet-democracy platform. Most stories of startup founders moving to Silicon Valley are similarly unique: as an outsider in their native environment, they made some sort of application or technology, got accepted to an accelerator in Silicon Valley such as YCombinator, and moved out to San Francisco.</p><p>Santiago fits right in in San Francisco: passionate about the potential for technology to impact incumbent processes, Santiago called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Satoshi Nakamoto’s blockchain</a> the next great invention behind Gutenberg’s printing press and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tim Berners-Lee’s world wide web</a>. In fact, Santiago shared that he documented the birth of his daughter on a blockchain as a publicly permanent declaration of her birth.</p><p>But where Santiago stands out is in his history with political activism starting in his hometown of Buenos Aires. In 2012, Santiago started <a href=\"http://partidodelared.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Partido de la Red</a>, a political party in Buenos Aires that was inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquid democracy</a>.</p><blockquote>To someone used to following American politics, starting a political party seems more difficult than landing a human on the moon.</blockquote><p>Traditionally dominated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peronism\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peronism</a>, opposing political parties in Argentina have had a long history playing second fiddle to the long-incumbent Peronist ideal that has won three-quarters of the presidential elections since it started in 1946. The Peronist ideal, rejecting both capitalism and communism, is not a political ideal easily captured by traditional western politics.</p><p>Since the ideals for Peronism were laid down in the 1940s, it’s flexibility in political views has allowed it to maintain dominance through a series of coups, martial law, corruption, political violence, and all the other things Argentina has gone through, much of which is still felt today. Walking through Plaza de Mayo, for instance, it’s hard to miss the white scarves painted on the ground as a symbol of the Mothers that would gather to protest state terrorism that kidnapped children without explanation.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20160925_154023.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Plaza de Mayo\" width=\"1200\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20160925_154023.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20160925_154023.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20160925_154023.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Nevertheless, in an attempt to address corruption in the political system, the Net Party was founded by Santiago as a grassroots attempt to build a political system around the voice of the people, implementing a voting platform to allow citizens to essentially act as a digital parliament. By implementing <a href=\"http://democracyos.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DemocracyOS</a>, an internet platform for collecting votes from citizens, representatives from the Net Party are better able to legislate in accordance to their constituents.</p><p>Liquid democracy, also known as delegative democracy, is an idea that builds on the concept of every citizen being able to elect their representative. Through liquid democracy, citizens are able to vote by vesting power in delegates rather than representatives.</p><blockquote>The difference between a delegate and a representative is that the barrier to entry of becoming a delegate is much lower than that of becoming a representative, and that citizens can shift power between delegates much more easily than they can representatives. Such a system aims to give more flexibility to each citizen, allowing individuals to become more or less involved at their choosing, and being better able to keep delegates accountable.</blockquote><p>I visited the DemocracyOS office in Buenos Aires to learn more about the open source project. The office is about the size of a large living room, complete with a loft that adds a few more desks for people to work. Since it’s inception, DemocracyOS has been implemented by governments in Argentina, Brazil, Spain, France, Finland, Hungary, and Colombia.</p><p>During my visit to the DemocracyOS office, the CTO of DemocracyOS Guido Vilariño, walked me through the code powering DemocracyOS, as I made my first pull request into the Node.js powered application. The ease at which I am able to personally contribute to this project and so many around the world speaks to the interconnectedness of global communities, allowing projects such as DemocracyOS to draw from a global group of volunteers and developers.</p><p>To Guido, DemocracyOS describes a future he is working to see to fruition. In our wide ranging conversation, Guido spoke with a guided sense of pragmatism recognizing that progress toward change requires intentional compromises, even if that means DemocracyOS is not quite implemented according to his ideals. Everyone who is a part of the efforts for Partido de La Red and DemocracyOS share a belief that the internet is having and will have irreversible effects on politics, starting with their efforts in Buenos Aires.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a system like DemocracyOS existing prior to the internet, as the logistical challenge of maintaining a liquid democracy system would be impossible without the aid of computers to keep track of the decisions made by each person. It’s still far too early to call DemocracyOS’s implementation of liquid democracy a success, but it’s not a stretch to say that DemocracyOS has impacted Buenos Aires in a tangible way, despite all the setbacks it has experienced.</p><p>The vision for DemocracyOS isn’t a partisan appeal, but one they hope to implement at a systemic level. However, because the Net Party is a political party, it is vulnerable to the same political partisanship that any party is subject to. It didn’t take long for Santiago to discover two problems. First, that forcing transparency into a system through political means is going to face pushback from the people benefitting from incumbent systems. And second, that people may use these tools of transparency as a political play to appear more transparent without actually becoming more transparent.</p><p>Today, Santiago no longer works on DemocracyOS. Emboldened instead by a mission that is broader and more ambitious in scope, Santiago tells me about the potential for the blockchain to give power back to the people. Calling his new project <a href=\"http://democracy.earth/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Democracy Earth</a>, Santiago hopes providing smart contracts via a blockchain for transparent decision making can bring back power to individuals.</p><p>The idea of a post-nation state world, as Democracy Earth is preparing for, is hard to picture given the state of international affairs today. And even if such a world will eventually come to pass, it’s hard to predict how we get to that day.</p><h1 id=\"vtaiwan-and-the-sunflower-movement\"><strong><strong>vTaiwan and the Sunflower Movement</strong></strong></h1><p>Beyond being known for it’s culture of endless street food, Taiwan is arguably the most progressive country in Asia. With a population of 23 million people, Taiwan is comparable in population to Australia. But because of historic geopolitical tensions with China, Taiwan’s relationship with the world is contentious and complicated. Outside of Taiwan, little has been understood about the dramatic political changes starting from Japanese rule in 1895 to the ending of martial law in 1987 to the first free election in 1996 to the vibrant democracy it is today.</p><p>Despite being a young, progressive democracy, Taiwan’s internal politics have been rooted in deep controversy. Still formally known as the Republic of China after the nationalists fled mainland China to Taiwan in 1949, the tensions between the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China have never been resolved. Today, only 2.4% of people between the ages of 20-29 in Taiwan identify themselves as Chinese.</p><p>The last time I was in Taiwan was 2005, when my travel experiences were still very much filtered through the itinerary set up by my parents, including visits to the zoo and other family excursions. But as I landed in Taiwan this past December, this time I was on my own: determined to ask hard questions about the sweeping, undeniable changes happening in Asia and around the world.</p><p>As a descendant of Taiwanese ancestry myself, uncovering the historical events along my lineage often left me perplexed, shocked, and in disbelief as I walked through the streets that raised my parents and grandparents. My grandparents have seen multiple cycles of politics in Taiwan, from growing up under Japanese colonialism and learning Japanese as a part of primary education to the Taiwan it is today.</p><p>In 2016, Taiwan elected its first female president <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsai_Ing-wen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tsai Ing Wen</a>, the former chairwoman of the Democratic People’s Party. Taiwan’s DPP, although with it’s own set of shortcomings, has positioned itself in modern years as being the progressive party advocating for LGBT rights, workers, and other typically liberal political ideologies. The DPP has significant anti-China sentiments, leaning on the side of independence from China.</p><p>As the public perception in Taiwan drifts further away from a historic Chinese identity, the Taiwanese identity becomes increasingly distinct from that of the Chinese. It is under these conditions that younger generations are forming their own national identities, growing up only knowing their country as a nation independent from China. I couldn’t help but ponder how easily I could have been Taiwan-raised, but for better or worse life dealt me a US passport instead of a Taiwanese one.</p><p>Economically, Taiwan was once the world’s factory. Everything used to come with “Made in Taiwan” tags and stickers. Known as one of the four tigers of Asia (the other three being Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea), Taiwan’s GDP grew at exceptionally high rates between the 1960s and the 1990s.</p><blockquote>But today, China is developing economically at rates unlike anything the world has ever seen before, causing Taiwan and other neighbors in the Asia-Pacific to cede markets to China because they can no longer compete.</blockquote><p>In a post pax-americana world, China stands to surpass the United States in global leadership, although it’s unlikely to happen in the near future. It is this rapid consolidation of economic and geopolitical power that is worrying the Taiwanese; a political stalemate causing Taiwan to pay extremely close attention to how China treats Hong Kong as a premonition of what Taiwan itself is likely to face.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"CKS memorial hall in Taipei\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2992\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>It is these circumstances in Taiwan that provides fertile ground for new political experiments. One effort to digitize civic participation in Taiwan is led by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Audrey Tang</a>, the youngest and first transgender official in Taiwan’s executive government. Audrey represents a new generation of political leaders, one that grew up with the internet, recognizes globalization, and is tasked with bringing a technology mindset into old, bureaucratic processes.</p><p>Audrey spends much of her time working on <a href=\"https://www.vtaiwan.org.tw/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vTaiwan</a>. vTaiwan is a liquid democracy platform that resembles DemocracyOS. Like DemocracyOS, vTaiwan gives everyday citizens the ability to weigh in on many issues that are important to them, allowing them to be more directly involved in their country’s politics. Through vTaiwan, citizens have participated in more transparent government conversations.</p><p>Audrey calls vTaiwan “a working implementation of multi-stakeholder consultation and crowd-sourced agenda setting”. From the outset, the challenge facing such a platform is making it a place for everyone, and avoiding it from skewing out in favor of one demographic or another.</p><p>This type of deliberative democracy was born out of the Sunflower Student Movement of 2014. As a prime example of the kind of organization that young people are willing and active in, demonstrators occupied the legislature for weeks in 2014 as a backlash to a proposed trade deal between Taiwan and China. The scale of such demonstrations was unprecedented, as the legislature has never been occupied by citizens in the history of Taiwan.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/13760423903_73c5a2e7ff_b-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>In the resolution of the Sunflower Movement, the students declared that one of their goals was to bring deliberation of policies into the community, bringing an even more open democracy to citizens.</p><p>As I learned about Taiwan’s history with little prerequisite knowledge, the biases from the different accounts and takes on historical events are obvious in a way that my own biases are not. The media landscape in Taiwan, although existing in a country that promotes free press, struggles with many of the same issues we see around the world. The drop in advertising and print revenue is placing a larger financial burden on publications in the US and around the world. But an additional problem facing Taiwan can be traced to cross-strait relations, creating an environment where pro-China publications are likely to receive funding from China, leaving other publications in Taiwan less staffed and resourced.</p><p><a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/authors/j-michael-cole/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">J Michael Cole</a> moved to Taiwan as a journalist nearly a decade ago, and after reporting for organizations such as the <a href=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taipei Times</a>, he has recently started a new Taiwan-focused media organization called <a href=\"http://taiwansentinel.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taiwan Sentinel</a> founded with the goal of providing in-depth reporting on Taiwan to an international audience.</p><p>In a brief conversation at the launch of Taiwan Sentinel, J Michael spoke about how even the top news organizations in the world have a hard time covering Taiwan. Austin Ramzy, a foreign correspondent for the New York Times, was forced out of China in 2014 and decided to relocate to Taipei to become the first Times journalist to be based out of Taiwan. Upon arriving, Austin met with J Michael only to realize how starkly different Taiwan is from mainland China.</p><p>The number of western journalists covering Taiwan is still next to none, but without a proper array of journalists, it’s hard for Americans and others to recognize the gravity of events happening in Taiwan.</p><p>After Tsai and Trump spoke over the phone following Trump’s election, a media firestorm erupted in response to Trump being the first head of state to speak with a Taiwanese head of state since diplomatic relations were cut off under Nixon. This media firestorm was highly critical in western outlets, but highly optimistic to the Taiwanese. Many Taiwanese saw it as a reconciliation of diplomatic relations between the two countries, but unfortunately, relations between Taiwan and the US are unlikely to improve under Trump.</p><p>These are the kinds of events that, when reported well, have the ability to shape popular opinion with a broader understanding of geopolitical relationships, prompting people to organize in ways such as the Sunflower movement.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>One way to measure the health of a democratic nation is how it protects a citizen’s human rights via rule of law, including protections of speech, assembly, press, voting, etc. However, another way to assess the health of a democracy is to look at how civically engaged it’s citizens are.</p><p>The measure of what is protected by law in a country is often an imperfect picture of whether a country’s people are benefactors and users of a democratic (or not so democratic) system. In fact, it’s possible to argue that the democratic health of a nation has more to do with how active citizens are civically than the agendas and laws written by the leaders: it’s the difference between what the system allows and how people are actually using the system.</p><p>The 2016 US presidential election saw less than 55% of voters turning out to vote, putting voter turnout in the model democracy lower than the majority of other countries. The decay of American democracy wasn’t in the fact that an inexperienced outsider won the electoral college, but that millions of Americans decided that they couldn’t be bothered to vote. Thus, despite the fact that laws in the US protect citizens’ rights to vote (voter ID laws and suppression aside), America’s democracy is threatened by a constant political apathy.</p><p>Whether or not you blame this outcome on a biased media and fake news on social media, news media often serves as the catalyst for political organization and action, manifesting itself as engagements with online platforms, physical protests, lawsuits, or anything else.</p><p>By the standards of participation, the measure of success for platforms like vTaiwan and DemocracyOS may not be so much the legislation or opportunities for civic engagement that they bring, but how it enables citizens to become more politically active. Being digital in nature, internet platforms such as the ones we’ve explored tend to skew toward younger, tech-savvy, educated citizens. The benefits of asynchronous, location-agnostic organizing also struggle to making sure a diverse set of voices are present in the constructive conversations and deliberations.</p><p>However, despite these challenges, digital platforms for civic engagement will continue to evolve, even as nations continue to wrestle with how to best regulate an internet that is not bounded by borders, easily manipulable, and constantly evolving to give their citizens new ways to engage, while also properly curbing cyberattacks.</p><p>Whether it be the blockchain, even more ubiquitous mobile devices, or smarter internet regulations, it’s inevitable that the final frontier for the internet revolution is going to be civic engagement, and it’s going to take far more than a president who uses Twitter to get us there.</p>","comment_id":"5f3779ae4c5532aa8134fbfb","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"status":"published","visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-08-15T05:59:10.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T10:11:26.000Z","published_at":"2017-05-06T06:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Drastic changes in technology and media are heavily influencing the pace and nature of change in our modern political establishment, increasing global uncertainty as more citizens are empowered to take action through digital tools and the internet.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none","tags":[],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"},"primary_tag":null,"url":"http://localhost:2369/digital-disobedience-internet-redefining-media-politics-around-world/","excerpt":"Drastic changes in technology and media are heavily influencing the pace and nature of change in our modern political establishment, increasing global uncertainty as more citizens are empowered to take action through digital tools and the internet.","reading_time":17,"send_email_when_published":false,"email":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},{"id":"5f377c264c5532aa8134fc06","uuid":"545dde13-6571-44d3-9c64-d6248e4ce618","title":"Why You Shouldn't Become a College Dropout","slug":"why-you-shouldnt-become-a-college-dropout","html":"<p>In college, I frequently thought about dropping out of school to pursue startup ambitions, but in retrospect, getting my degree was the better choice.</p><p>Four years ago, I sat down with my parents and handed them a proposal for taking a gap year. I spent weeks excruciating over this letter, finally articulating all of my thoughts into words:</p><blockquote>“…Many of my peers attend and eagerly await nothing but the end. Learning becomes a burden and a chore, and done solely for the sake of obtaining a diploma. I want to be able to clearly see the difference between learning for the sake of actually knowing vs learning for the sake of finishing school. Seeing a world outside of what I currently know and am used to will give me a perspective / reality check whenever I feel unmotivated to learn…”</blockquote><p>Long story short, I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life, and wanted time before college to figure that out.</p><p>At least that’s what I told my parents. My real struggle wasn’t entirely about figuring out what I wanted to do with my life, but also about figuring out why higher education would be valuable to me. At the time, I saw college as an expensive waste of time filled with empty promises of material success that I would leave me unfulfilled.</p><p>All my high school friends seemed to be talking about the schools they wanted to attend while I spent my days considering why college would be valuable for me. I heard many reasons over and over for the next few months, but none of them satisfied me. I was dissatisfied with the system, jaded by all the contrived homework questions and classes.</p><p>I couldn’t see how doing homework and taking tests would help me in the real world of business and engineering. I couldn’t see how going through a four year program would be more time and cost effective in learning the skills I needed in my career.</p><p>When I consulted with my parents and other mentor figures in my life at the time, I felt like I was speaking on a different wavelength. It seemed that I was being carried by a stream of blind faith that “engineering was the only way to make a living” and that I had to go to college to get into those jobs. But as I boiled down their points into things that I could consider, I heard a few very common reasons that I should get a college degree.</p><h3 id=\"-you-need-a-college-engineering-degree-to-get-a-job-\">“You need a college engineering degree to get a job.”</h3><p>As kindergarteners, our teachers welcomed us to class by asking us what we wanted to be when we grew up, encouraging us to follow our aspirations of becoming firefighters, authors, teachers, etc. But the older we got, the responses to these “childish” ambitions turned into not-so-subtle demands to take advanced math classes in order to pursue more lucrative professions.</p><p>We were inundated with talk from parents and peers about the schools and jobs that “people they know” got in a seemingly endless comparison of one’s worth to their education and career pedigrees. And yet, despite all the talk about getting in to good schools, the emphasis seemed to be placed on one of three fields: engineering, medicine, or law.</p><p>Dissatisfied with those arguments, I found myself inspired by stories of people who went against conventional wisdom to make significant contributions in their fields without having a college degree: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. I spent sleepless nights listening to speeches, reading books, and watching documentaries about these larger-than-life figures, hoping to extract the things that made them great and apply them to my life.</p><p>With so many examples of successful people who had dropped out of college as well as college graduates that struggled to secure employment, I concluded that the prerequisites for success surely must be independent from whether someone actually followed through with college or not. If education was nothing more than a series of hoops that people had to jump through to obtain a piece of paper, there had to be more effective ways of building up credibility in a field. I could probably teach myself practical aspects of computer science instead of getting stuck in the theory taught by academia.</p><h3 id=\"-college-is-a-place-to-meet-people-and-build-a-network-\">“College is a place to meet people and build a network.”</h3><p>One of the most common things that people would tell me was about the people they had the opportunity to meet in college, forming the strongest groups of friends that they still interact with in their adult lives. They argued that the college years was the best time to make friends, build a professional network, and date.</p><p>This point made little sense to me, as college life was as appealing as getting tangled into a web horrible frat parties, boring lecture halls, and awful dorm experiences while paying obscene amounts to do so. How was I going to find a network among other students? I wanted to meet and learn from top figures in industry, not students that would ask to copy my homework.</p><p>I couldn’t see how attending college would help me build a network of connections that would help me start my career, because everyone that I wanted to network with weren’t anywhere close to academia. I looked up to programs like the <a href=\"http://thielfellowship.org/\">Thiel Fellowship</a> and <a href=\"http://uncollege.org/\">Uncollege</a> because they gave their fellows access to networks of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.</p><h3 id=\"-college-gives-you-time-to-experiment-before-being-in-the-real-world-\">“College gives you time to experiment before being in the real world.”</h3><p>To many, college is also the time for people to try things and learn from mistakes. If the goal is to move fast and break things, I was told that college would be a place where I could make mistakes in a safer sandbox.</p><p>But if college is supposed to be a sandbox for me to learn and experiment before going out into the world, why is it structured as a series of classes and lectures? To me, things like grades, curves, and application processes made college feel more like a competition rather than the experimental laboratory that people were telling me it would be. Additionally, it seemed more appealing to experiment outside of the walls of academia, where the money that would be going toward tuition would go much further than what I might get out of academia.</p><p>I felt that a self-education system based on traveling, reading, and one-on-one meetings would be much more personalized and impactful personally. I could read books on my own, meet with experts, and travel for less than the cost of a year’s worth of tuition. And with so much content available online, I could access any information whenever I wanted to.</p><h1 id=\"so-what-is-college-for\">So What is College For?</h1><p>But despite all these reservations about the value of higher education, I went.</p><p>One night toward the beginning of my freshman year, I was sitting on the Warren lawn talking to a few new friends I had just made. I had been hesitant to share my reservations about higher education with anyone up to that point, but that night I made my thoughts known.</p><p>“I don’t know if I’ll stay in college. I mean, I don’t see the point.”</p><p>In retrospect, telling people that you might leave college is not the best way to make friends as a freshman, but somehow these people stuck with me and became my best college friends. As college life quickly enveloped every aspect life, I struggled with an inner voice doubting if I was doing the right thing with my life.</p><p>I went through most of my first year trying to figure out how to make the most of my college education, given the fact that I didn’t feel like my education had a purpose. I attended events whenever I could, always looking for an excuse to spend time away from my campus. I didn’t really care about my grades, and slipped into academic probation toward the middle of my sophomore year.</p><p>I remember opening that email and seeing a hideous 1.866 GPA. At that moment, I was met with a real decision: Either I would put more effort into my academics or I would leave entirely and work full-time on my self-education that I had been doing concurrently with college.</p><p>Then, a few weeks later, I found myself on a trip to Silicon Valley with <a href=\"http://brighteyes-students.org/\">BrightEyes</a>, a program designed to give UCSD students a tour of startups and venture capital in Silicon Valley. I was talking to <a href=\"http://tiffanydstone.com/\">Tiffany</a>, the director of the BrightEyes program, asking for advice on how I should reconcile my startup ambitions with my education.</p><p>“You need to finish school.” She told me.</p><p>Coming back after BrightEyes, I reluctantly decided I would invest more into my academics. I pulled myself out of academic probation, but the question remained: what is the point of college?</p><p>At some point in my junior year, I came across an <a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2015/09/the-neoliberal-arts/\">article by William Deresiewicz</a> that challenged my fundamental assumptions about college.</p><blockquote>“This is education in the age of neoliberalism. Call it Reaganism or Thatcherism, economism or market fundamentalism, neoliberalism is an ideology that reduces all values to money values. The worth of a thing is the price of the thing. The worth of a person is the wealth of the person. Neoliberalism tells you that you are valuable exclusively in terms of your activity in the marketplace — in Wordsworth’s phrase, your getting and spending.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>It is not the humanities per se that are under attack. It is learning: learning for its own sake, curiosity for its own sake, ideas for their own sake. It is the liberal arts, but understood in their true meaning, as all of those fields in which knowledge is pursued as an end in itself, the sciences and social sciences included. History, sociology, and political-science majors endure the same kind of ritual hazing (“Oh, so you decided to go for the big bucks”) as do people who major in French or philosophy. Governor Rick Scott of Florida has singled out anthropology majors as something that his state does not need more of. Everybody talks about the STEM fields — science, technology, engineering, and math — but no one’s really interested in science, and no one’s really interested in math: interested in funding them, interested in having their kids or their constituents pursue careers in them. That leaves technology and engineering, which means (since the second is a subset of the first) it leaves technology.”</blockquote><p>Little did I know, but this one essay would lead me to realize that the purpose of a university education is so much greater than the career that would be enabled as a result. Yes, college degrees often serve as a funnel into specific careers, but seeing college as merely a means to a job is selling it short of what it really is.</p><p>Learning for the sake of applying it to a career to make money is hollow at best. Learning is so much more than that; it’s about exploring the creative aspects of humanity, thinking deeply about existence, relationships, and phenomena in our universe. It’s about learning for learning’s sake, allowing curiosity to lead you where money won’t, and becoming a more informed citizen.</p><p>At a certain level, universities represent the best of this curiosity. Whether it be forays into areas of arts, humanities, and literature or scientific endeavors to sequence the human genome, curiosity enables universities to create the world of tomorrow. Universities are home to some of the most groundbreaking and innovative research that currently exists. The fundamental incentives and structure of university research leads to technology breakthroughs that would not be discovered in industry. Just consider physics research as CERN, Oceanography research at UCSD, etc.</p><p>The value of a college degree isn’t about the student experience, future careers, or social circles. College is valuable for the exploration and discovery of yourself, the world, and how the two interact. It’s about being alongside faculty and professors that are pioneers in their respective fields, whether it be biological research, quantum physics, or another field.</p><p>The fact that public universities are exempt from the pressures to build and sell products in the same way that corporations are allows public universities to approach subjects from a different angle, giving students and faculty the freedom to explore natural phenomenon, history, etc without worrying about finding profitable applications for their research.</p><p>This allows academia to explore things at a much deeper, more holistic level, often allowing them to do research that is far ahead of industry, and working out the fundamental theory of why things work. There’s a general trend of people criticizing universities for being too theoretical and not adequately preparing students for the real world, but the truth is that we need universities to continue focusing on theory. Specifics become obsolete much faster than theory does.</p><p>As a society ingrained in the profit motive, it’s no surprise that colleges market themselves as a place for students to learn how to be successful in industry. But as I had to figure out on my own, that’s not the point of an education. We need to start having real expectations of what college is and what it isn’t. College isn’t optimized for being successful in the workplace, it’s optimized for creating an environment that lets people explore deeply on the issues we face today.</p><p>College isn’t for everyone, especially given the calculus of going to college for an economic incentive. But regardless, college is an opportunity that everyone should have, regardless of race, class, status, or gender. And for those interested in jumping straight into a career, we should be giving apprenticeship and bootcamp programs much more consideration in the talent pipeline.</p><p>Once I decided that my college education wasn’t about establishing a future career for myself, it freed me to dive deeper into the things I wanted to learn just for the sake of learning. I found myself enjoying classes and assignments for this first time, appreciative of being able to learn from and talk to the faculty that was teaching me.</p><p>So to everyone who helped me through my college years, I have two things to say. First, sorry if I was difficult through the years in my frustrations. And second, thank you for your support, I would not be where I am today if I hadn’t gone through college.</p>","comment_id":"5f377c264c5532aa8134fc06","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"status":"published","visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-08-15T06:09:42.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-29T06:16:19.000Z","published_at":"2016-08-30T06:09:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"In college, I frequently thought about dropping out of school to pursue startup ambitions, but in retrospect, getting my degree was the better choice.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none","tags":[],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"},"primary_tag":null,"url":"http://localhost:2369/why-you-shouldnt-become-a-college-dropout/","excerpt":"In college, I frequently thought about dropping out of school to pursue startup ambitions, but in retrospect, getting my degree was the better choice.","reading_time":9,"send_email_when_published":false,"email":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},{"id":"5fce46020018b65fcd9d5532","uuid":"265c2741-d55c-4874-b14d-8f890762c30c","title":"The Promise of Education Technology","slug":"promise-education-technology","html":"<p>Around this time last year, I was chatting with one of my friends about the recent trend of college hackathons and he blurted, “wouldn’t it be awesome to have a hackathon at the white house?” We talked about it a bit before getting back to our homework.</p><p><em><u>This is the transcript of the TEDx talk I gave at UCSD, which is linked at the bottom of this post.</u></em></p><p>I am a computer scientist by training, but as someone who has been in school for the majority of my life, I’ve spent a good amount of time reflecting on my own education.

Students all over the country are using technology in their education, in everything from research to video projects to computer science.</p><p>Albemarle County Schools in Charlottesville Virginia is one example among many pockets of primary and secondary schools that <a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-02-albemarle-county-schools-journey-from-a-makerspace-to-a-maker-district\">have received national acclaim for the success of their makerspaces</a>, inspiring many of their K12 students to use creative technological mediums to share what they’ve learned.</p><p>And through the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/connected\">ConnectEd initiative of the Obama administration</a>, more schools in the US are providing internet access to their students than ever before, helping students to prepare themselves to work with the digital tools that are ubiquitous today.</p><p>But as the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/asian-nations-dominate-international-test-100159386.html?ref=gs\">test scores of our nation has fallen far behind</a> those of China, Singapore, Japan, Korea, and Finland, people are justified in pointing out that our efforts with education technology have not given us the results that our technology had promised.</p><p>Technology was supposed to improve education by making it higher quality, more accessible, and more affordable. But while technology has improved education for some, it hasn’t been as successful as we’ve been hoping for as a nation.</p><p><strong><strong>What happened? Wasn’t technology supposed to come in as the grand superhero and solve all of our problems as it did for so many other sectors? As a Silicon Valley native, I wondered: what would it take for technology to disrupt education?</strong></strong></p><h2 id=\"down-the-rabbit-hole\">Down the Rabbit Hole</h2><p>Pondering this point for myself, I went on a journey to learn as much as I could about our education system, venturing far outside the perimeter of the technology sector.</p><p>Remember that conversation about hackathons we had? In September of 2015, my friend became an intern at the White House and I started interning at the US Department of Education. I couldn’t believe it.</p><p>But that was only the beginning. How would two interns convince senior staff to let us host such an event? Interns don’t just come in and tell people what to do. And the prospect of hosting a “hackathon”, a type of event rather foreign to public officials, would prove to be a very difficult task. The White House doesn’t even have Wi-Fi.</p><p>After brainstorming some ideas only to have them sit on the desks of white house staff, we had a better idea: what if we did it as a part of CS Education Week?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GOPR0025.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"DCIM100GOPRO\"></figure><p>On December 7th, 2015, we welcomed teachers, developers, and students to the white house for a CS Tech Jam as a part of Computer Science Education week. Participants had a simple goal: to start something that would improve CS Education in America’s public elementary schools, addressing early STEM biases that keep girls and minorities out of computer science.</p><p>We brought in teams from Sphero, Glasslab Games, Magic Leap, Google, and more along with local high school and college students and teachers from all over to US.</p><p>Projects at the tech jam included a simple game to programmatically play chutes and ladders, a game to learn about logic gates, and an instagram-like app that allowed users to upload code that rendered into artistic animations.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GOPR0031_1449503045616_high.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"DCIM100GOPRO\"></figure><p>This is a picture of the team from Magic Leap brainstorming with a few teachers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GOPR0040_1449504860953_high.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"DCIM100GOPRO\"></figure><p>This is the team building the game for students to manipulate logic gates.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CSEdWeek2-TechJam.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"CSEdWeek2-TechJam\"></figure><p>By bringing together tech companies, teachers, and students, all voices were critical in creating something that would truly be effective. It was in that moment that I had a key realization about education.</p><p>John King, the current secretary of education, in a closing address at the tech jam that we hosted, spoke about the importance of bringing all stakeholders into the conversation.</p><blockquote>“I was encouraged by the level of listening that was taking place. As I visit schools around the country, too often you see technology tools that might have made a difference in theory, but aren’t actually working for kids in the classroom.” – John King</blockquote><p>That day showed me that it was the dialogue between students, educators, and developers that become powerful ideas for education. When we come to the table willing to listen and understand, we are able to personally invest ourselves in a mission that isn’t just about us, but about fundamentally adding value to the people we are serving.</p><p>But what does this have to do with technology?</p><h2 id=\"the-conversations-in-edtech\">The Conversations in Edtech</h2><p>The legend of Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs himself tried many things to improve education with technology.</p><blockquote>“I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.” – Steve Jobs</blockquote><p>The three months I spent at the department of education gave me a bigger picture of the incredibly diverse set of issues that our education system in the United States faces that is unique to our own country. Not only do we have students of every single racial and cultural identity, we have to address different languages, social norms, and expectations.</p><p>Steve Jobs was correct given his assumption of education, but his assumption was fundamentally flawed: He approached education technology as a charitable donation that he hoped would automatically improve teaching and learning. But simply giving a student a computer doesn’t mean that their grammar is going to automatically improve.</p><p><strong><strong>Contrary to the ethos of Silicon Valley, education can’t be disrupted with a single solution.</strong></strong> With so many different stakeholders in such complicated dynamics, getting technology implemented in education isn’t about companies developing and pushing their ideas, but about the conversations with everyone involved: students, teachers, administrators, developers, and more.</p><p>It’s about understanding the problems and utilizing technology only when it is the best tool for the problem. With so many diverse problems in our education system, improving education with technology starts with understanding the types of problems students face on a regular basis. Too often we forget to consider how our decisions impact students of lower socioeconomic statuses, minorities, and other marginalized students.</p><p>In contrast to Steve Job’s statement of using technology in teaching and learning, former secretary of education Arne Duncan framed it in the context of technological access.</p><blockquote>“I worry that technology is not being implemented fast enough. Technology has the ability to improve equity in our public schools, or the ability to exacerbate current equity gaps.” – Arne Duncan</blockquote><p>Trying to unify the two perspectives led me to my next question: Given that we can’t make assumptions about the solutions that students need, what are the problems that all students, especially disenfranchised students, struggle with on a regular basis?</p><h2 id=\"listening-to-students\">Listening to Students</h2><p>To answer this question, I turned to the tools I know best: web programming. I started thinking about technology in a different way; not just technology as a potential to augment teaching and learning, but as a means of civic engagement and empowerment.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-07-30 15.36.13(2)\"></figure><p>With a student run nonprofit named Student Voice, I got together with a group of friends and put together <a href=\"http://www.sturights.org/\">the Student Bill of Rights</a>, a collection of 12 rights covering everything from free expression to health and well being to technology.</p><p>Then, in order to allow students to share what matters most to them, I built a voting platform around the 12 rights and allowed students to vote on the three rights most important to them.</p><p>Here is what we found: Of over 1000 students who voted, the most voted on right was free expression, followed by fair assessment, and personal learning. What all three of these have in common is the emphasis on the students. Students want to express themselves, to be understood, and to make education their own.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.222.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-07-30 15.36.22(2)\"></figure><p>And yet, in an effort to make high school graduates more “college and career ready”, students are increasingly taught to fulfill educational standards in compliance with No Child Left Behind and Common Core, which inherently detracts from a student’s ability to personalize their learning.</p><p>And even some of the technological pushes in education have been nothing more than putting lectures online, worksheets in a digital format, and multiple choice exams on a screen. It is this lack of personal agency that is reflected in the voting results.</p><p><strong><strong>Perhaps the first responsibility of our education systems is to listen to our students.</strong></strong></p><p>To make the quantitative qualitative, we paired the digital voting with a national tour, visiting schools all over the country. On our national tour, Andrew Brennen, the National Field Director for Student Voice, took the step to listen to students and their stories. Here are a few of them.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12779052_980745521975099_8902773440712492291_o.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"12779052_980745521975099_8902773440712492291_o\"></figure><blockquote>“Our field trip account is zero. Our activities account is zero. We keep getting told that all of our money is in the general fund and can’t be used for things like textbooks or paper. This general fund seems great though, some mysterious crazy place. How can I get some of this general fund?”</blockquote><p>This next story, from a refugee student belonging to a group where students openly share stories, showed me the importance of allowing students to freely express themselves before they can be comfortable in their classrooms.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o (1)\"></figure><blockquote>“…After my dad died I was so depressed. I could never leave my house. I could never talk to anybody. But when my mom said let’s go on vacation I was feeling like sure. So we went but then when I saw the border I was like wait where are we. After that my mom said we were going to the US and I was like, “What? You never told me that! You never told me anything!” And I start crying more and more and more. I hated my mom for those fifteen days because she never really told me what was going to happen but at the same time I feel happy because if she would’ve told me, I would never have come with her. I got here legally. One of the happiest things when I got here was that I got to meet my uncles and my grandpa. Those people were never in my life before but now they really help me out.”</blockquote><p>These are only a few of the many incredibly personal stories that we’ve collected and shared through our online platforms. And hopefully by getting a small glimpse of what students go through on a regular basis, you’ve come to a similar conclusion that I did: Maybe we’ve been looking at education technology wrong this whole time.</p><p>Technology shouldn’t be a sterile, programmatic medium for students to standardize their learning. It needs to be a tool that allows them to further express their creativity and emotions in a safe way. I don’t see the journey of education as a deterministic computation, I see it as a beautiful mess of emotions, struggles, and community.</p><p>Students are people full of ideas, emotions, problems, character, nuance, culture, ambitions, and thoughts. Students spill out in ways that don’t fit within conventional boundaries. Just look at student organized movements like the Vietnam war protests, demonstrations against genocides overseas, civil rights and black lives matter – students have always been at the forefront of taking action to be the change they want to see in the world.</p><p>I’m not saying that protests are the only way to improve education, but we do need to be heard. Education is not the responsibility of the government, nor is it the responsibility of the teacher. It is the responsibility of the whole community: students, teachers, parents, and educators to dialogue about the things we can do to improve our schools, our country, and the world.</p><p>The ways that students have organized looks vastly different from generation to generation, and as our generation sets the example for what it means to bring equity and equality in our technological age, I hope that you are as proud as I am to be a student attending school in america today.</p><p>As students, we are all inadvertantly part of a dialogue that transcends our education systems, whether we are aware of it or not. It is through this dialogue that we have the choice to empower or silence the voices of the students around us. It may be hard to believe that your voice matters in the big picture of education, and that’s how I felt before organizing the White House Tech Jam.</p><p>Education has a long way to go before we solve the problems of quality, equity, affordability, and accessibility. And whether we achieve those solutions through technology or otherwise, it begins with students like us participating in this dialogue. How will you participate in this dialogue?</p><p>I’m going to leave you with a confession:</p><p>I started this journey thinking it would be about technology, but it’s not about the technology; it’s about the student.</p>","comment_id":"5fce46020018b65fcd9d5532","feature_image":"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/12/CSEdWeek2-TechJam.jpg","featured":false,"status":"published","visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-12-07T15:10:58.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:13:26.000Z","published_at":"2016-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none","tags":[],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"},"primary_tag":null,"url":"http://localhost:2369/promise-education-technology/","excerpt":"Around this time last year, I was chatting with one of my friends about the\nrecent trend of college hackathons and he blurted, “wouldn’t it be awesome to\nhave a hackathon at the white house?” We talked about it a bit before getting\nback to our homework.\n\nThis is the transcript of the TEDx talk I gave at UCSD, which is linked at the\nbottom of this post.\n\nI am a computer scientist by training, but as someone who has been in school for\nthe majority of my life, I’ve spent a good amount of time refle","reading_time":10,"send_email_when_published":false,"email":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},{"id":"5f7835122493c2c88d8d40e9","uuid":"e2122844-8919-4907-b21e-2d74a23ea16b","title":"Intro to HCI Lecture 3 – Heuristic Evaluation","slug":"intro-to-hci-lecture-3-heuristic-evaluation","html":"<p>These are my notes in essay form from the Intro to Human Computer Interaction course taught by <a href=\"http://d.ucsd.edu/srk/\">Scott Klemmer</a> at the University of California, San Diego. All credit for content goes to Scott, any errors are my own.</p><p>After you’ve made your prototypes, the next step is learning how to properly get feedback from people. There are many different ways to get feedback, but simply asking for feedback is often hard to organize and understand. Users who simply tell you that they like or dislike something is not an interesting conversation.</p><p>You can empirically access your product with real users, use formal methods and formulas to calculate measures, or you can use a critiquing framework such as heuristic evaluation. With heuristic evaluation, you begin your review with a clear goal. Developed by Jakob Nielsen, heuristic evaluation allows you to easily find usability problems in design.</p><h2 id=\"before-a-heuristic-evaluation\">Before a Heuristic Evaluation</h2><p>The first question to ask when it comes to getting design critique is figuring out when to get critique. You can get feedback at any point in the design process, but there are a couple points that may be particularly helpful.</p><p>The first point to get design critique is before user testing. By getting critique and fixing small usability issues, users who test your product are able to better focus on the big issues. The second point is before a redesign. To avoid throwing out the baby with the bathwater, a proper critique helps you learn what works and what needs to be improved. Thirdly, critiques should also be performed when you know there are problems, but you need evidence. And finally, smooth out the rough edges before a release by performing a final critique.</p><p>Next, in order to perform a heuristic evaluation, you need to find evaluators to evaluate your user interface according to usability principles, known as heuristics. To diversify feedback, it helps to have multiple heuristic evaluators work independently and then communicate afterwards to aggregate findings. Having multiple evaluators is helpful because no single evaluator finds everything, and some evaluators find more than others.</p><p>Heuristic evaluation works well on working user interfaces as well as wireframes, making it highly compatible with the principles discussed in rapid prototyping such as paper prototypes. It works with designs of any fidelity.</p><p>Additionally, from a cost-analysis standpoint, heuristic evaluations are also extremely cost-effective. One analysis of heuristic evaluation found that a company benefitted approximately $500,000 from results generated in heuristic evaluation when applied to increase productivity, while only costing the company $10,500.</p><p>Compared to user testing, heuristic evaluation is much faster and affordable, and are often able to find the most severe problems easily. Another benefit is that because of the nature of the heuristics the results come pre-interpreted, making it easy to know exactly what to redesign. However, user testing by definition is always more accurate than heuristic evaluations, because you are testing the product in the exact scenarios that it is to be used. Thus, heuristic evaluations can often generate false positives, leading you to consider some aspects as problems when they may not necessarily be a problem.</p><p>Thus, when it comes to testing, it often is valuable to alternate testing methods in order to maximize for cost, effectiveness, and time.</p><h2 id=\"conducting-a-heuristic-evaluation\">Conducting a Heuristic Evaluation</h2><p>To conduct a heuristic evaluation process, begin by giving your evaluators any needed domain knowledge and information on the scenario. You can do this by sharing your storyboards, video prototypes, or any other information that may give the evaluators the necessary background information for you interface.</p><p>Each evaluator should pass through the interface flow at least twice. The first pass allows the evaluator to get a good feel for the flow and scope of the system, while the second pass allows the evaluator to focus in on specific elements. While they step through the flow, each evaluator should consult the list of heuristics (explored in detail further down in this post), and make notes on anything that they notice.</p><p>The comments should thoroughly explain the problem with reference to a specific heuristic. Comments can be specific to the wording of a certain label in the interface, or can be general to address to flow of the user interface, as long as the design team is able to understand what the problem is. Comments can even be about aspects that are missing in the user interface, which is often the case especially in paper prototypes.</p><p>For each comment that an evaluator makes, have them determine how severe each identified problem is. This helps give the design team feedback on which problems they may want to prioritize. For example, a problem identified in one page in the user interface may not be as severe as a problem that affects every single page of the interface.</p><p>When determining severity, the frequency, impact, and persistence of the problem should be factored in. According to Nielsen’s framework of heuristic evaluation, severity ratings are between 0 and 4, with 0 being that it is not a usability problem and 4 being a usability catastrophe.</p><p>Each violation should be listed separately in order to better organize the problems identified. Listing each problem separately minimizes the risk of repeating problematic aspects, and makes each problem clearer and easier to understand.</p><p>Finally, have the evaluators share their findings and aggregate all the problems and severities that they have found in the interface. The design team can then take the feedback they received from the evaluators and decide what they would like to do with the feedback.</p><p>The debrief is a great time to clarify the feedback, and brainstorm ways to fix the problems as well as develop ways to implement new features with all the stakeholders in one place.</p><h2 id=\"the-ten-heuristics\">The Ten Heuristics</h2><p>As mentioned above, Nielsen has <a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/\">a set of ten heuristics </a>that can be used as guidelines to evaluating user interfaces. These guidelines are not all encompassing, which means the evaluator can make comments or suggestions that do not necessarily belong with one specific heuristic.</p><h3 id=\"show-system-status\">Show system status</h3><p>The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. This helps the user know what the progress of the current task is, and where he or she is in the larger system flow.</p><p>In situations where the user is waiting on the system, the user interface should provide some sort of status indicator. If the task that the system performs generally takes less than one second, the system can simply show the outcome. If the task takes approximately a couple of seconds, then there should be an indicator to let the user know that progress is underway. And if the tasks takes over a couple of seconds, it is a good idea to have a fractional status indicator showing the current status and time.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.31.53\" width=\"700\" height=\"184\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184.png 700w\"></figure><p>Another example of system status is space. In the following example, gmail provides an indicator letting the user know that they are out of space.</p><p>The third example of system status is change. The dialog boxes that appear when forgetting to saving files will often warn you about pending losses to the information at hand.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.32.52-700x267.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.32.52\" width=\"700\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.32.52-700x267.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.32.52-700x267.png 700w\"></figure><p>The fourth example is action. For instance, a stoplight prompts a specific type of action, whether it be recognizing that a driver can cross a street or a driver should not cross a street. The stoplight is also an example of a good interface because it also provides a redundant method of indication, putting red at the top and green at the bottom. This redundancy allows stoplights to serve a wider base of users.</p><p>The fifth example is showing information about next steps. Especially in an online world, it is good practice to let the user know what is happening next.</p><p>And finally, after finishing whatever task is at hand, it is good to indicate that a process has completed.</p><h3 id=\"familiar-metaphors-and-language\">Familiar metaphors and language</h3><p>The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</p><p>One example of an effective metaphor is found in the print dialog box, because it shows which parts of the page are going to be cropped and which parts are going to be printed in a very clear way. In general, one of the advantages of the graphical user interface is that it leverages a lot of real world metaphors such as the desktop, files, trash, folders, etc.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.33.14\" width=\"700\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494.png 700w\"></figure><p>Choices are another area in which it is helpful to use familiar language. Even if a dialog box uses language that may be a bit more technical, make the choices clear for people who may not be as technically aware.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.34.56-700x261.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.34.56\" width=\"700\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.34.56-700x261.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.34.56-700x261.png 700w\"></figure><h3 id=\"user-control-and-freedom\">User control and freedom</h3><p>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.</p><p>If the task being done is a task that is only done once, a constrained wizard may be helpful to guide the user through the process. However, the user interface should always provide the user with a way to exit out of a flow or go back. Allowing the user to explore gives them the freedom to interact with the interface the way they want.</p><h3 id=\"consistency-and-standards\">Consistency and standards</h3><p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</p><p>Just like familiar language should be used in your interface, consistent language should be used as well. Despite the fact that a design team may be organized in a certain way, the user may not see their experience in the same way. This difference between designers and users can be confusing for users navigating your interface.</p><p>One solution to this problem is to train your users and design team to use the same language when referring to the product, making it easier to understand from both perspectives. Being very specific about what interface choices do can also help provide a more standard experience across all users.</p><h3 id=\"error-prevention\">Error prevention</h3><p>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.</p><p>The first kind of error to prevent people from making is data loss. For example, if a file is about to be overwritten, a user may not recognize what is in a file simply by looking at the filename, which means the user could run the risk of unintentionally overwriting data.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.35.11-700x371.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.35.11\" width=\"700\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.35.11-700x371.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.35.11-700x371.png 700w\"></figure><p>You can also prevent errors by preventing duplicates and clutter. Warning users that files may potentially be a duplicate is a great way of preventing users from accidentally doing something twice. Removing clutter and confusing flow also helps the users accomplish what the intended to do.</p><p>One advantage of graphical user interfaces is that they can use a visual structure to limit the errors that a user may make. For example, anything that you can type into a graphical search form can be used as the term to search with, while searching via the terminal must be done with the specific command syntax.</p><p>Avoiding unnecessary constraints helps reduce the number of errors that users encounter. In many situations, the user may perform a task only to find that some constraint on their task caused an error. Removing unnecessary constraints helps the user through the application flow much more smoothly.</p><h3 id=\"recognition-rather-than-recall\">Recognition rather than recall</h3><p>Minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.</p><p>Interfaces should avoid use of cryptic codes, conventions, or other knowledge that the user may need to remember when interacting with the interface. Interfaces should be as easy to understand as possible. Any time you notice a post-it note used to explain or remind a user of something, that is usually a problem caused by users needing to remember some key piece of information in order to perform a task.</p><p>Recognition is also about avoiding extra hurdles that a user may have to go through in order to accomplish their task. Sometimes this means initializing the interface with reasonable defaults to make a task faster for your user.</p><p>In addition to initializing with reasonable defaults, it is also valuable to provide previews. Offering previews helps users to recognize whether or not the choice they are making is the one that they want rather than relying on a description or previous knowledge.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.35.55-700x416.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.35.55\" width=\"700\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.35.55-700x416.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.35.55-700x416.png 700w\"></figure><h3 id=\"flexibility-and-efficiency\">Flexibility and efficiency</h3><p>Accelerators, unseen by the novice user, may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</p><p>The easiest way to increase efficiency is to provide keyboard shortcuts for experienced users to navigate your application better.</p><p>Another example of increasing flexibility is being able to look under the hood at the HTML of a web page. This is not necessarily something that everyone will want to do, but it offers experts with the ability to see how a web page is built.</p><p>Flexible interfaces can also display ambient information that may be relevant to the interface at hand, such as showing the weather forecast on a calendar application. Recommendations can also serve as a flexible interface element that can help the user be more efficient at the task they are trying to accomplish. However, if you use recommendation, remember to keep it relevant so that it’s not distracting to the user.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.36.17-700x400.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.36.17\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.36.17-700x400.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.36.17-700x400.png 700w\"></figure><p>Even though flexibility is important, it is also important to not go overboard with choices to avoid confusing the user and making it difficult to find what he or she is trying to do.</p><h3 id=\"aesthetic-and-minimalist-design\">Aesthetic and minimalist design</h3><p>Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.</p><p>One of the characteristics of designing for the web is that the user can only see part of the web page at a time, leading to the distinction between above the fold (initially visible content) and below the fold (content that is accessed by scrolling). It is important to make the core components of your software visible as much as possible, keeping it above the fold. Additionally, it helps to lay out forms and other interfaces in a simple, intuitive way to simplify the process and save space.</p><p>When using colors, use them in a way that the colors mean something. Avoid inundating your users with colors that distract from the flow of the interface.</p><h3 id=\"recognize-diagnose-and-recover-from-errors\">Recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h3><p>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</p><p>The first step in sending an error is to make the problem clear. An error that does not provide a clear explanation of the problem often leaves users confused as to what their next steps should be.</p><p>The next step is providing a solution to the problem. Simply notifying the user of a problem may not be as helpful as recommending ways to fix the problem. Providing a way forward helps the user to continue the task at hand without disrupting the flow too much.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.42.49-700x235.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.42.49\" width=\"700\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.42.49-700x235.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.42.49-700x235.png 700w\"></figure><p>Another consideration when recovering from errors is to propose an alternative. Especially in the world of online searches, it is helpful to provide alternatives in the case that a search returns no results.</p><h3 id=\"help-and-documentation\">Help and documentation</h3><p>Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user’s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</p><p>It can be assumed that help and documentation is someone else’s problem and not a part of the interface, but with the growth of online applications, help is becoming more common.</p><p>One example of this is the learning process for learning new programming languages. Most languages have their documentation online, which serves as a guide for programmers to receive help learning.</p><p>Another example is pointing out new features in the application when they are released, helping the user recognize how a new feature might be beneficial to them.</p>","comment_id":"5f7835122493c2c88d8d40e9","feature_image":"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/2015-01-31-03.32.46-1-2.jpg","featured":false,"status":"published","visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-10-03T08:23:46.000Z","updated_at":"2020-10-03T08:31:35.000Z","published_at":"2015-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"These are my notes in essay form from the Intro to Human Computer Interaction course taught by Scott Klemmer at the University of California, San Diego.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none","tags":[],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"},"primary_tag":null,"url":"http://localhost:2369/intro-to-hci-lecture-3-heuristic-evaluation/","excerpt":"These are my notes in essay form from the Intro to Human Computer Interaction course taught by Scott Klemmer at the University of California, San Diego.","reading_time":11,"send_email_when_published":false,"email":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},{"id":"5f782e892493c2c88d8d40d6","uuid":"748bf9ca-1086-4308-b571-fcce079a3a6b","title":"Intro to HCI Lecture 2 – Prototyping","slug":"intro-to-hci-lecture-2-prototyping","html":"<p>These are my notes in essay form from the Intro to Human Computer Interaction course taught by <a href=\"http://d.ucsd.edu/srk/\">Scott Klemmer</a> at the University of California, San Diego. All credit for content goes to Scott, any errors are my own.</p><p>After you’ve done the interviews and generated personas, the next step is to begin developing prototype solutions for the problem you are trying to solve. As a note to the development process, the fidelity of your work will increase as you get further along in the development process. Be careful to choose the tools that are most appropriate for the stage you are developing to avoid wasting time.</p><p>Based upon your needfinding, you should have been able to identify a couple key problems that your users are having, which should allow you to generate a point of view on the problem at hand.</p><p>For example, a point of view may be “waiting in line is intrinsic, but the boredom is not”. This would lead to design solutions like showing news or playing games while waiting in line. Alternatively, your point of view might be “with a good scheduling interface, no one should have to wait in line.” This might lead to better ways for employees to staff registers and consumers to pick them. Or, you might have a totally different point of view: “let’s make grocery stores more like farmers’ markets, where payment is distributed across the stands that have the food.”</p><h2 id=\"brainstorming-ideas\">Brainstorming Ideas</h2><p>The biggest challenge in developing solutions that solves these problems is that we all have blinders that keep us from discovering the best solution. The greatest ideas are achieved by transcending the blinders and thinking outside the box.</p><p>There are two good examples of this. The first one is the classic problem of connecting all the dots in a three by three dot matrix by only drawing four lines.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/9dots.svg_.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"9dots.svg\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\"></figure><p>If you think inside the box, as most people do, you’ll never find the solution to this problem. But by thinking outside of the box, you discover that by extending lines outside of the grid you are able to achieve the goal.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/Ninedots.svg_.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Ninedots.svg\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\"></figure><p>The second example is another classic riddle known as Duncker’s candle problem. Based on the items in this picture, (candle and a box of thumbtacks) how do you fix the candle to the wall without the wax dripping onto the table?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/candle-problem-heuristic_383.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"candle-problem-heuristic_383\" width=\"321\" height=\"324\"></figure><p>There are a lot of creative answers to this riddle, but by thinking outside the box and thinking about the box as a tool that can help you achieve your goal, you realize that you can do this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/candle-problem-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"candle-problem-3\" width=\"303\" height=\"293\"></figure><p>In order to think outside of the box, we often have to brainstorm as many prototypes as possible in order to find the best ones. In this stage of the development process, developing a large quantity of prototypes rather than developing the quality of the prototype increases your chances of success down the line.</p><p>You’ll usually be able to think of the first couple solutions quickly and without much effort, but it is often the combination of multiple ideas that allows for the emergence of the best idea. Don’t stop after you think you’ve found a good solution, brainstorm solutions until you have absolutely exhausted your ability to come up with more.</p><p>If you find yourself unable to think of out of the box ideas, framing the problem in a different way or thinking about it from a different angle often helps. For instance, In the candle problem, when the problem is presented with the box being a separate object than simply a container for the thumbtacks, participants are able to come up with the solution more consistently.</p><p>As an experiment in an art class, the teacher divided her students into two groups. The first group was told that they would be evaluated on how many pieces of art they were able to produce, while the second group was told that they would be evaluated by the quality of the best piece of art they made.</p><blockquote>“While the quantity group was busily churning out piles of work- and learning from their mistakes- the quality group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts tan grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay”</blockquote><p>Thus, the question when it comes to prototyping is how can we consistently and reliably get people outside the frame? What are the subtle differences in framing that make big differences?</p><p>One strategy for thinking outside the box, as illustrated in the art class example, is to encourage people to design and build in parallel rather than in serial. By producing a large number of prototypes, we are able to separate ego from artifact, as well as encouraging comparison and transfer. Designers are less likely to get attached to one specific approach that may blind them from seeing a better solution.</p><p>With the recent advent of web analytics, we have been able to more finely track the engagement and success of advertisements. When comparing ads done in parallel versus ads done in serial, developing and sharing multiple design leads to more individual exploration, more feature sharing, more conversational turns, better consensus, and an increase in group rapport.</p><p>Additionally, what the web analytics revealed was that ads that were designed with a parallel approach got more visitors and engagement than ads designed in serial. In fact, ads that were developed in parallel generated longer time on site, was more diverse, and was clicked on more frequently.</p><h2 id=\"storyboarding\">Storyboarding</h2><p>To begin developing prototypes to solve problems, it often helps to create storyboards. Storyboarding allows you to think about a problem from the perspective of the personas that you’ve created, enabling you to look outside of the box and think about and share the pain points that your users go through.</p><p>In essence, storyboarding is all about tasks. Like developing personas, it helps to have a story created from each demographic of users. By developing stories and envisioning how your solution would fit into the everyday tasks of your users, developing prototypes becomes much more clear. The holistic focus allows you to emphasize how a user interface accomplishes a task without committing to a specific user interface.</p><p>Much like a comic strip, storyboards also communicate flow. Good storyboards clearly show the flow between different steps of a task to help get all the stakeholders on the same page in terms of the goal.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/4174319172_61e5aae5f3_o.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"4174319172_61e5aae5f3_o\" width=\"1130\" height=\"1505\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/4174319172_61e5aae5f3_o.png 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/4174319172_61e5aae5f3_o.png 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/4174319172_61e5aae5f3_o.png 1130w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>photocredit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/doos/4174319172/\">Rob Enslin</a></figcaption></figure><p>One of the common remarks people make about storyboards is that they are unskilled at drawing. However, storyboards aren’t about how well you can draw. Storyboards are about communicating the underlying ideas of what users go through to accomplish a task. In fact, bad drawings often allow you to focus solely on the ideas.</p><p>Ultimately, storyboards should convey:</p><ul><li>Setting – Who are the people involved, what is the environment like, and what is the task being accomplished?</li><li>Sequence – What steps are involved, what leads someone to use the app, and what task is being illustrated?</li><li>Satisfaction – What motivates people to use this system, what does it enable people to accomplish, and what need does the system fill?</li></ul><h2 id=\"paper-prototypes\">Paper Prototypes</h2><p>The goal for building prototypes, as mentioned previously, is not about building the most aesthetically pleasing prototype, but building something that expresses the functionality and approach of your solution.</p><p>In terms of software applications, prototyping can be done without writing a single line of code. We can fake a product to make more prototypes in a short amount of time.</p><p>By prototyping your user interfaces with paper, you can easily show other people what your design could potentially look and feel like. Paper prototypes are also easily manipulated and changed, making it easy to receive feedback on your ideas.</p><p>When making paper prototypes, be creative and use different kinds of tools and resources to build your prototype. For example, you may use post it notes to simulate the effects of a popup window, or a menu that overlays on top of the interface. Another helpful hint is to use a photocopier to quickly duplicate different elements of your prototype.</p><p>Good paper prototyping is kind of like playing make believe as a kid. Using different sizes of paper, color, transparencies, index cards, and whatever else you can work with cheaply and quickly, you can convey almost any idea to other people.</p><p>The other advantage of paper prototypes is that they are easy to edit. Anyone with a pen can quickly make a change to how the prototype looks or how it works, making it easy to get other people’s ideas into the system and empowers them to play a more active role in the design process.</p><h2 id=\"video-prototypes\">Video Prototypes</h2><p>Another approach to further showcasing a storyboard is to create video prototypes. Video prototypes allow for a cheap, quick, and powerful visualization of how an idea is supposed to work. By sharing a story through a video that captures how the product is supposed to work, stakeholders can better visualize and understand how a solution could work. A video prototype can change what the team argues about in a good way.</p><p>Like good storyboards, video prototypes share a story in a self-explanatory, portable way. Good video prototypes show a whole task, including motivation and success. A good way to do this is to show the pain points, frustrations, as well as the success of a person executing on a task.</p><p>When creating a video prototype of any fidelity, ensure that you focus on the message rather than the quality of the video. You don’t need a high quality video camera in order to capture a video prototype, any smartphone will do. Make sure you create a realistic scenario that people can understand. Try not to spend too much time editing your video prototype because editing can be extremely time consuming.</p><h2 id=\"the-wizard-of-oz\">The Wizard of Oz</h2><p>If you’ve ever watched the Wizard of Oz, you’re likely to be familiar with the story of how the group (Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion) traveled their long journey in hopes of meeting magical wizard. When they finally get to the castle, they discover that the giant wizard is nothing more than a small man controlling a large puppet.</p><p>In the same way when building prototypes, early prototypes can simply be a human operated mirage to simulate the interface to the users. This approach is much faster, cheaper, and more iterative while also being more real than paper prototypes.</p><p>One example can be seen in the way that a startup company named Aardvark demonstrated their concept to their users. Aardvark was an application that allowed a user to ask a question and be automatically paired up with one of their friends who was most qualified to answer the question. However, their prototype did not have the matching algorithm implemented yet, so they used a “wizard” to manually select who the question would be sent to.</p><p>If the users loved the wizard of oz prototype, they’ll love the real thing even more. However, there are a couple caveats to pay attention to when testing with a wizard of oz prototype. The higher fidelity the prototype is, the more users will think it is completed, and the less likely users will feel to offer critiques. On the contrary, lower fidelity prototypes will often generate more feedback, but may not capture the exact interaction you are looking for.</p><p>Additionally, to make a wizard of oz prototype, the “wizard” must understand the flow of the application in order to properly manipulate the application. Thus, the application flow must be carefully laid out and rehearsed in order to avoid errors in the demonstration, maximize consistency, and lower the response time necessary to perform the “wizard” tasks.

All credit for content goes to Scott, any errors are my own.</p><p>One starting point for designing new products and technology is to clearly identify an existing problem or need. This is because finding big problems often yields important untapped opportunities for design. By observing people, you build empathy and put yourself in their shoes.</p><p>One example is an electronics firm that makes devices for truckers. These devices were underused by Truckers, and when asked why, the responses were minimal. However, it wasn’t until designers went into the field that they found that the truckers’ big hands and large gloves made it difficult to use the tiny keys on these devices.</p><p>The designers took this information and created a redesign that provided common responses with one click as opposed to lots of typing. The new device featured a dynamic display with big buttons and a stylus for precision input when necessary.</p><blockquote>“You can observe a lot just by watching.” – Yogi Berra</blockquote><p>Observing people is only one of the ways to begin designing an effective user interface. However, it’s often a good strategy to begin your design process by interacting with your users.</p><p>In 1914, Bronisław Malinowski travelled to Papua New Guinea to conduct fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands. While he was there, World War I broke out, leaving Malinoski with the choice of either hanging out in the Trobriand Islands or being interned. Needless to say, Malinoski decided to stay on the Trobriand Islands.</p><p>During his time on the islands, Malinowski developed the practices of participant observation which remain a hallmark of ethnographic research to this day.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/le-journal-de-la-triennale-4-on_ne_reste_pas_au_meme_endroit-melaniebouteloup_v10_img_50.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"le-journal-de-la-triennale-4-on_ne_reste_pas_au_meme_endroit-melaniebouteloup_v10_img_50\" width=\"1200\" height=\"789\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/le-journal-de-la-triennale-4-on_ne_reste_pas_au_meme_endroit-melaniebouteloup_v10_img_50.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/le-journal-de-la-triennale-4-on_ne_reste_pas_au_meme_endroit-melaniebouteloup_v10_img_50.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/le-journal-de-la-triennale-4-on_ne_reste_pas_au_meme_endroit-melaniebouteloup_v10_img_50.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This idea of “Deep Hanging Out” as coined by Genevieve Bell is exactly what Malinowski did with the natives. Deep Hanging Out is spending time with people doing their work and living their lives. By doing this, you can get beneath the surface of what people say to learn about what they actually do.</p><p>If you’ve ever lived in another country, you’ve realized that every culture has traditions and rituals that may be unfamiliar and foreign to you. But you don’t have to go very far to recognize the beautiful complexity of culture.</p><p>For example, being a student requires an enormous amount of practical knowledge and constitutes a large number of practices that are enacted every day that students are rarely conscious of because it’s an everyday behaviour. But if someone were to be suddenly dropped into being a student with no knowledge of what student life was like, they’d have all sorts of trouble. Furthermore, many of the practices that are part of everyday behavior can be difficult to articulate.</p><p>Therefore, there are five key things to learn by observing participants:</p><h3 id=\"1-what-do-people-do-now-what-s-the-baseline-that-we-re-starting-from\">1 – What do people do now? What’s the baseline that we’re starting from?</h3><p>Getting a full understanding of the culture, practices, and rituals of your target audience provides an understanding of your audience that is extremely helpful. Digging deep into the motivations, emotions, and aspirations of your audience allows you to better understand where to begin.</p><h3 id=\"2-what-values-and-goals-do-people-have\">2 – What values and goals do people have?</h3><p>Most often, we’ll want to build technologies that align with what people care about and what they hope to accomplish. This doesn’t mean literally building what people have asked for because people often don’t know how to best achieve their goals, especially for disruptive technologies. Instead, this is about designing technologies that will weave themselves into the fabric of people’s everyday lives, even if they introduce new concepts and functionality.</p><h3 id=\"3-how-are-these-particular-activities-embedded-in-a-larger-ecology-of-behaviors\">3 – How are these particular activities embedded in a larger ecology of behaviors?</h3><p>For the individual bus or subway user, the bus or subway segment is a part of a larger activity like getting to a friend’s house commuting to work, or going to the grocery store. By understand the constraints and goals of the large activity, you may come up with ideas that you wouldn’t have if you were just thinking about the bus ride more narrowly.</p><p>By figuring out why someone would choose to take the bus or not take the bus, you as the designer might end up with something more broad, like creating a mobile application that helps people figure out when a bus is coming, or the best way to get from one destination to another.</p><p>Taking this broader view can help you be more effective as a designer by helping you design for the larger activity that people are engaged in.</p><h3 id=\"4-what-similarities-and-differences-can-be-found-across-different-people\">4 – What similarities and differences can be found across different people?</h3><p>In our bus example, a low mobility user might care enormously about the accessibility of the bus, while somebody else may be concerned primarily with the cost, and yet another person may be concerned primarily with the efficiency in getting there.</p><h3 id=\"5-what-other-contexts-like-time-of-day-influence-people-s-behaviors\">5 – What other contexts, like time of day, influence people’s behaviors?</h3><p>Pay attention to any other things that may contribute to the way that people are behaving. This requires paying very close attention and observing the nuances of what people do.</p><h2 id=\"observing-the-experienced\">Observing the Experienced</h2><p>Another good strategy for finding needs is to be an apprentice under someone who has experience with the area you are working on. For example, if you’re building a better supermarket checkout system, you could find needs by apprenticing as a clerk and learning the different workarounds that clerks do as a part of their job.</p><p>One illustration of the power of being in the presence of an expert comes from Jack Whalen and colleagues at Xerox PARC. While studying a call center for photocopier repair, they found that diagnosing photocopiers over the phone can be extremely difficult.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, after studying the support staff, they found that the most effective person was the person who had been working there the longest. To their surprise, however, the second most effective person wasn’t the person that had been working their the second longest, but the person who had been sitting next to the most effective person. Thus, by sitting next to an expert, these repair technicians were able to pick up all of the informal skills of doing repair work that aren’t written down in manuals anywhere, which were the skills that helped somebody really excel in their job.</p><p>If you see something that catches your eye while being an apprentice, be sure to interact and validate it with the people you’re working with so you can better understand why things are done the way that they are. Additionally, pay attention to all the artifacts that compose people’s work, because the ways that people have hacked their equipment to make their work more effective is an indication of ways to innovate.</p><p>For example, Post-It notes have traditionally been used as artifacts to help users more easily navigate different routines. Think about a fax machine or other piece of equipment that has Post-It notes reminding people how to use stuff.</p><p>A harmful attitude about designing, although less common nowadays, is the tendency to think people who can’t figure out how to use technology are simply incompetent. Using another example from Xerox PARC, Lucy Suchman recorded a video, that has now become legendary, of two people trying to produce a double sided copy of 50 pages of paper.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/whenuserhitsmachinexeroxstills.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"whenuserhitsmachinexeroxstills\" width=\"321\" height=\"489\"></figure><p>According to legend, when Lucy shared the video with the executives, they wrote the users off as dumb. However, when it was revealed that the two users were Allen Newell and Ron Kaplan, two of Xerox’s premier research scientists, they were no longer able to say that it was because the users did not know how to use technology. Ultimately, this video shows that if you are unfamiliar with a particular piece of technology, it can be difficult to figure out how to use it without an intuitive user interface.</p><h2 id=\"interviewing\">Interviewing</h2><p>When it comes to interviewing, one key distinction that must be made is the difference between what people say and what people do.</p><p>For example, Walmart conducted a study asking its customers whether they would like the aisles to be less cluttered. Unsurprisingly, the participants of the study responded affirmatively. Walmart then proceeded to declutter their aisles, remove inventory, and lost a billion dollars in sales.</p><p>What happened? In this situation, Walmart made two key mistakes. First, they listened to what people said rather than paying attention to what people did. Second, they asked a leading question. Those two mistakes led them to do exactly the opposite of what would be most effective.</p><blockquote>“If I asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses” – Henry Ford</blockquote><p>The starting point of any good interview is picking a good interviewee. A good collection of interviews from people of different backgrounds allows for diverse perspectives that can better help you spot trends that are common among different perspectives. If you are trying to interview people for a product you are building, you may be able to glean good insights from people who are current users of a similar system as well as people who are non-users.</p><p>Good interviewees can be found through friends and family, as well as sites like Craigslist or even Twitter. (You may need to provide compensation as an incentive for people to take interviews)</p><p>However, you may not always be able to get an interview with the ideal person, so you may need to approximate. The key is to be open to any insights or thoughts that users or potential users may have.</p><p>One group of users, known as lead users, can be extremely helpful in the interview process as well as the development process. Lead users are the knowledgeable early adopters that can help provide valuable feedback that can directly help you build a better product.</p><h2 id=\"asking-good-questions\">Asking Good Questions</h2><p>What makes a good question when you’re interviewing? Take this example and decide whether this is a good question. The question is: “Is the daily update an important feature to you?” When asked a question like this, most users would say “Yes.” It’s kind of a leading question. Most people, when asked if something’s important, would say “Sure, why not?” What’s at stake? Why would you say no? If you wanted to learn about the daily update, participant observation might be a lot more effective because you could see whether people actually use the daily update. Or you might even use log files as a way of driving your questions. So, for example, you might ask somebody, “I see from the log that you’ve never used the daily update. Why is that? Tell me more.”</p><p>Other kinds of questions to avoid:</p><ul><li>Questions that ask what users would do, like, or want in hypothetical situations – These questions often generate replies based on a person’s ideal, hypothetical world, not necessarily what they would actually do.</li><li>Questions that ask how often users do things – Asking a user how often they go to the gym generates responses that reveal how often they’d like to go to the gym, not actually how often they do.</li><li>Questions that ask how much they like things on an absolute scale – Asking a user how much they like something is often not extremely valuable or insightful.</li><li>Binary questions – Questions that only have two answer choices, like questions that ask on an absolute scale do not provide any significant insights into how you should build your product.</li><li>Good questions are questions that are open-ended, have a specific goal, and are unbiased. For example, instead of asking how often a person goes to the gym, you should ask them to tell you about the most recent time that they went to the gym.</li><li>Having a specific goal with each question allows you to uncover specific things with each question. If a question leaves your interviewee stumped for a little bit, that is a good thing. A little bit of silence is golden.</li></ul><p>One common problem for people who are new to interviews is that they often say that there’s nothing to be found for the problem they’re tackling because it’s either impossible or obvious. However, it’s rarely the case that there is nothing new. Malcolm Gladwell has a wonderful explanation in the introduction to his new book of collective stories “What the Dog Saw”.</p><blockquote>“The trick to finding ideas is to convince yourself that everyone and everything has a story to tell. I say trick, but what I really mean is challenge, because it’s a very hard thing to do. Shampoo doesn’t seem interesting? Well, dammit, it must be, and if it isn’t, I have to believe that it will ultimately lead me [to something] that is.” – Malcolm Gladwell</blockquote><p>If an interviewee’s answer doesn’t quite answer what you were trying to get out of the question, follow up with other questions that clarify what you’re trying to get at. Paying attention to how your questions are answered also allows you to better understand how to ask good questions that generate the answers you’re looking for.</p><p>Examples of good questions:</p><ul><li>When was the last time you used a specific application?</li><li>What were the first things you did when you woke up this morning?</li><li>What are three words you would use to describe your experience with a specific task?</li><li>What did you do after a certain circumstance / situation happened?</li></ul><h2 id=\"other-interviewing-considerations\">Other Interviewing Considerations</h2><p>Another consideration to keep in mind is the location of the interview. Interviews should take place in as realistic of a location as possible. For example, interviewing grocery shoppers is best done in grocery stores because it allows the interviewee to answer based on physical triggers that cause different behaviors that might not be mentioned otherwise. Conducting interviews in realistic location also allows you as the interviewer to better understand what your interviewee is talking about.</p><p>A common question about interviewing is whether or not it should be recorded. Recording audio or video has benefits as well as drawbacks that should be considered. The drawbacks of recordings are that they can be time consuming to review and edit, requires permission, but most importantly can change a participant’s response. However, recordings provide a robust record and can help you focus on interviewing so you don’t have to do that while taking notes.</p><p>A good compromise is taking photos. Photos are quick and easy to take, provide a visual record, but does so without changing a participant’s response.</p><h2 id=\"beyond-interviewing\">Beyond Interviewing</h2><p>Although interviewing is a great way to do user research, interviewing also has it’s limits. Interviews only provide a snapshot of what a user’s experience is like, and is often limited by what the user tells you.</p><p>One solution to this problem is doing a diary study. Essentially, a diary study prompts users to record their thoughts or feelings based on some trigger. This could be asking the user to take a picture every time they eat a meal, write down how they feel every time they watch a television show, or something along these lines. This allows you to sample users’ experience at given points throughout their day.</p><h2 id=\"personas\">Personas</h2><p>The final step, after conducting as many user interviews as you possibly can, is to develop personas. Personas are fictional characters that you use to represent the demographics of your users. For example, if you are developing a messaging application, your personas can include teenage males who are using your messaging app to keep up with his classmates as well as middle-aged mothers who are using the app to message their kids.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/persona-example1-700x525.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"persona example\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"http://localhost:2369/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/persona-example1-700x525.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/persona-example1-700x525.jpg 700w\"></figure><p>The value in having personas is being able to quickly pinpoint different use cases among different demographics of people. By assigning a concrete name to a certain demographic, it becomes easier to keep that specific demographic in mind. Personas should be as detailed as possible, and be a compilation that most accurately represents different groups of your users.</p><p>Beyond just demographic information, however, a persona should also capture a person’s motivations, beliefs, intentions, behavior, and goals. In other words, give your persona a story to tell. It also helps to put a face to the persona, so that you can easily visualize the person that you are developing for. Having this information makes the next step, prototyping, much easier.</p>","comment_id":"5f77f4e42493c2c88d8d40a7","feature_image":"http://localhost:2369/content/images/2020/10/2015-01-31-03.32.46-1.jpg","featured":false,"status":"published","visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-10-03T03:49:56.000Z","updated_at":"2020-10-03T04:18:29.000Z","published_at":"2015-02-01T03:51:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"These are my notes in essay form from the Intro to Human Computer Interaction course taught by Scott Klemmer at the University of California, San Diego.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none","tags":[{"id":"5f33f5d7f4c9bc65cca4be6c","name":"Works","slug":"works","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2020-08-12T13:59:51.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T13:59:51.000Z","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2369/tag/works/"}],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Daniel Kao","slug":"daniel","email":"dkao@diplateevo.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/93e1328b59023ca4779808c6df2538f8?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\"]","last_seen":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:09:14.000Z","roles":[{"id":"5ef75589efaa0112adeb5a19","name":"Owner","description":"Blog Owner","created_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T14:19:53.000Z"}],"url":"http://localhost:2369/author/daniel/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"5f33f5d7f4c9bc65cca4be6c","name":"Works","slug":"works","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2020-08-12T13:59:51.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T13:59:51.000Z","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2369/tag/works/"},"url":"http://localhost:2369/intro-to-hci-lecture-1-needfinding/","excerpt":"These are my notes in essay form from the Intro to Human Computer Interaction course taught by Scott Klemmer at the University of California, San Diego.","reading_time":11,"send_email_when_published":false,"email":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},{"id":"5f782d082493c2c88d8d40c3","uuid":"2c9f5026-05e5-4a03-9693-c0797eb4ff39","title":"On Ambiverts: Why Distinguishing Between Extroverts and Introverts is Inadequate","slug":"on-ambiverts-why-distinguishing-between-extroverts-and-introverts-is-inadequate","html":"<p>I’ve always hated the distinction between introverts and extroverts because I never could identify with either side. The accepted school of thought is that a person is either one or the other, without any middle ground.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator\">Myers Briggs</a>, perhaps the most widely popular and accepted personality test, extroverts are action oriented, seek breadth of knowledge and influence, prefer frequent interaction, and get energy from spending time with people while introverts are thought oriented, seek depth of knowledge and influence, prefer more substantial interaction, and get their energy from spending time alone.</p><blockquote>However, contrary to the binary choices provided by Myers Briggs, I’ve realized that extroversion/introversion is a spectrum, like a person’s height.</blockquote><p>All of my life, I’ve had people (family, close friends, teachers, counselors) tell me different things. Some would say I was an introvert, and others would say that I was an extrovert. To different people I seemed to be different things.</p><p>After browsing the web and looking at a few more resources and doing some reflection, I came across a term called the ambivert, and finally felt understood by a personality test. I am very much an ambivert. There seems to be very little written about ambiverts, (Evernote isn’t even recognizing it as a word) so here are my thoughts.</p><p><strong><strong>Ambiverts sit on the spectrum of social interaction right in between the introverts and extroverts.</strong></strong> Ambiverts love spending time with people, but get tired after spending too much time around people. Ambiverts are also very capable of doing things alone, but spending an entire day alone can suck them into a depressed, unproductive mood.</p><p><strong><strong>Ambiverts love interacting with people, but in a very purposeful way.</strong></strong> Ambiverts can have extremely animated and interactive conversations, or mellow and meditative ones. Ambiverts will defend both their personal time as well as their social time.</p><p><strong><strong>Ambiverts process information best when they process internally and externally.</strong></strong> Ambiverts need time and space to process things on their own, but they also need people who they can trust to process things with externally. In order for ambiverts to fully process information, they usually need both.</p><p><strong><strong>Ambiverts seek breadth of knowledge and influence, but dive deep when they are truly passionate.</strong></strong> Ambiverts can be thought or action oriented, depending on the situation, but they are also oftentimes both.</p><p>The challenge for ambiverts is finding one thing to stick with. Because ambiverts do well socially and individually, it’s easy for an ambivert to become the jack of all trades, having knowledge in many different areas but not necessarily an expert an any of them.</p><p>Ambiverts tend to do well adapting to any situation that they are placed in, whether it be a loud social scene or a secluded environment.</p><p>However, no matter if you identify as an extrovert, introvert, or ambivert, don’t let a personality test define how you think about yourself. Figuring out how you work best for yourself is much more helpful than any test.</p><p>What do you think?
