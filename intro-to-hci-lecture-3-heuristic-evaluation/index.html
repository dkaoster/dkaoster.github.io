All credit for content goes to Scott, any errors are my own.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> After you’ve made your prototypes, the next step is learning how to properly get feedback from people. There are many different ways to get feedback, but simply asking for feedback is often hard to organize and understand. Users who simply tell you that they like or dislike something is not an interesting conversation.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> You can empirically access your product with real users, use formal methods and formulas to calculate measures, or you can use a critiquing framework such as heuristic evaluation. With heuristic evaluation, you begin your review with a clear goal. Developed by Jakob Nielsen, heuristic evaluation allows you to easily find usability problems in design.</p> <h2 lang=en> Before a Heuristic Evaluation</h2> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The first question to ask when it comes to getting design critique is figuring out when to get critique. You can get feedback at any point in the design process, but there are a couple points that may be particularly helpful.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The first point to get design critique is before user testing. By getting critique and fixing small usability issues, users who test your product are able to better focus on the big issues. The second point is before a redesign. To avoid throwing out the baby with the bathwater, a proper critique helps you learn what works and what needs to be improved. Thirdly, critiques should also be performed when you know there are problems, but you need evidence. And finally, smooth out the rough edges before a release by performing a final critique.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Next, in order to perform a heuristic evaluation, you need to find evaluators to evaluate your user interface according to usability principles, known as heuristics. To diversify feedback, it helps to have multiple heuristic evaluators work independently and then communicate afterwards to aggregate findings. Having multiple evaluators is helpful because no single evaluator finds everything, and some evaluators find more than others.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Heuristic evaluation works well on working user interfaces as well as wireframes, making it highly compatible with the principles discussed in rapid prototyping such as paper prototypes. It works with designs of any fidelity.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Additionally, from a cost-analysis standpoint, heuristic evaluations are also extremely cost-effective. One analysis of heuristic evaluation found that a company benefitted approximately $500,000 from results generated in heuristic evaluation when applied to increase productivity, while only costing the company $10,500.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Compared to user testing, heuristic evaluation is much faster and affordable, and are often able to find the most severe problems easily. Another benefit is that because of the nature of the heuristics the results come pre-interpreted, making it easy to know exactly what to redesign. However, user testing by definition is always more accurate than heuristic evaluations, because you are testing the product in the exact scenarios that it is to be used. Thus, heuristic evaluations can often generate false positives, leading you to consider some aspects as problems when they may not necessarily be a problem.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Thus, when it comes to testing, it often is valuable to alternate testing methods in order to maximize for cost, effectiveness, and time.</p> <h2 lang=en> Conducting a Heuristic Evaluation</h2> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> To conduct a heuristic evaluation process, begin by giving your evaluators any needed domain knowledge and information on the scenario. You can do this by sharing your storyboards, video prototypes, or any other information that may give the evaluators the necessary background information for you interface.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Each evaluator should pass through the interface flow at least twice. The first pass allows the evaluator to get a good feel for the flow and scope of the system, while the second pass allows the evaluator to focus in on specific elements. While they step through the flow, each evaluator should consult the list of heuristics (explored in detail further down in this post), and make notes on anything that they notice.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The comments should thoroughly explain the problem with reference to a specific heuristic. Comments can be specific to the wording of a certain label in the interface, or can be general to address to flow of the user interface, as long as the design team is able to understand what the problem is. Comments can even be about aspects that are missing in the user interface, which is often the case especially in paper prototypes.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> For each comment that an evaluator makes, have them determine how severe each identified problem is. This helps give the design team feedback on which problems they may want to prioritize. For example, a problem identified in one page in the user interface may not be as severe as a problem that affects every single page of the interface.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> When determining severity, the frequency, impact, and persistence of the problem should be factored in. According to Nielsen’s framework of heuristic evaluation, severity ratings are between 0 and 4, with 0 being that it is not a usability problem and 4 being a usability catastrophe.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Each violation should be listed separately in order to better organize the problems identified. Listing each problem separately minimizes the risk of repeating problematic aspects, and makes each problem clearer and easier to understand.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Finally, have the evaluators share their findings and aggregate all the problems and severities that they have found in the interface. The design team can then take the feedback they received from the evaluators and decide what they would like to do with the feedback.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The debrief is a great time to clarify the feedback, and brainstorm ways to fix the problems as well as develop ways to implement new features with all the stakeholders in one place.</p> <h2 lang=en> The Ten Heuristics</h2> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> As mentioned above, Nielsen has <a class=svelte-bu32sq href=http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/ rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>a set of ten heuristics </a>that can be used as guidelines to evaluating user interfaces. These guidelines are not all encompassing, which means the evaluator can make comments or suggestions that do not necessarily belong with one specific heuristic.</p> <h3 lang=en> Show system status</h3> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. This helps the user know what the progress of the current task is, and where he or she is in the larger system flow.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> In situations where the user is waiting on the system, the user interface should provide some sort of status indicator. If the task that the system performs generally takes less than one second, the system can simply show the outcome. If the task takes approximately a couple of seconds, then there should be an indicator to let the user know that progress is underway. And if the tasks takes over a couple of seconds, it is a good idea to have a fractional status indicator showing the current status and time.</p> <div class="svelte-1f31tvi image-wrap full"><picture class=svelte-1f31tvi><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-480w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-768w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-1024w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-1400w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1920px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-1920w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-480w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-768w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-1024w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-1400w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1920px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184-1920w.jpg type=image/jpeg> <img alt="Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.31.53" class=svelte-1f31tvi loading=lazy src=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.31.53-700x184.jpg cardwidth=full title="" width=700></picture> </div> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Another example of system status is space.

For instance, a stoplight prompts a specific type of action, whether it be recognizing that a driver can cross a street or a driver should not cross a street. The stoplight is also an example of a good interface because it also provides a redundant method of indication, putting red at the top and green at the bottom. This redundancy allows stoplights to serve a wider base of users.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The fifth example is showing information about next steps. Especially in an online world, it is good practice to let the user know what is happening next.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> And finally, after finishing whatever task is at hand, it is good to indicate that a process has completed.</p> <h3 lang=en> Familiar metaphors and language</h3> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> One example of an effective metaphor is found in the print dialog box, because it shows which parts of the page are going to be cropped and which parts are going to be printed in a very clear way. In general, one of the advantages of the graphical user interface is that it leverages a lot of real world metaphors such as the desktop, files, trash, folders, etc.</p> <div class="svelte-1f31tvi image-wrap full"><picture class=svelte-1f31tvi><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-480w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-768w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-1024w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-1400w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1920px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-1920w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-480w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-768w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-1024w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-1400w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1920px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494-1920w.jpg type=image/jpeg> <img alt="Screenshot 2015-02-13 02.33.14" class=svelte-1f31tvi loading=lazy src=/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2015-02-13-02.33.14-700x494.jpg cardwidth=full title="" width=700></picture> </div> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Choices are another area in which it is helpful to use familiar language.

Support undo and redo.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> If the task being done is a task that is only done once, a constrained wizard may be helpful to guide the user through the process. However, the user interface should always provide the user with a way to exit out of a flow or go back. Allowing the user to explore gives them the freedom to interact with the interface the way they want.</p> <h3 lang=en> Consistency and standards</h3> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Just like familiar language should be used in your interface, consistent language should be used as well. Despite the fact that a design team may be organized in a certain way, the user may not see their experience in the same way. This difference between designers and users can be confusing for users navigating your interface.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> One solution to this problem is to train your users and design team to use the same language when referring to the product, making it easier to understand from both perspectives.

Sometimes this means initializing the interface with reasonable defaults to make a task faster for your user.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> In addition to initializing with reasonable defaults, it is also valuable to provide previews.
