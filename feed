            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On January 11th, 2020, Taiwan went to the polls to elect their next President and Legislature. In Taiwan’s short history as a democracy, this election was only the 7th presidential election that Taiwan has held, conducted after months of unrest in Hong Kong and an increasing trend of populism around the world. For us at <a href="https://international.thenewslens.com/">the News Lens</a>, we formed a small team of designers, engineers, and editors to build <a href="https://international.thenewslens.com/interactive/126882">this year’s election tracker</a>.</p><p>2020年1月11號，台灣舉辦了總統立委大選。從台灣民主化到現在的時間不長，這只是第七次總統大選。這段時期，香港正發生反送中事件，以及世界許多國家有往民粹主義發展的趨勢。我和在<a href="https://www.thenewslens.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">關鍵評論網</a>的厲害設計師、編輯和產品長藉著這個機會做了一個<a href="https://www.thenewslens.com/interactive/126883" rel="noopener nofollow">特別的專題</a>。</p><h2 id="product">Product</h2><h2 id="-">產品規劃</h2><p>Before we started planning the technical details, we began by thinking about election coverage as a product: What do readers care about? What are their reading habits / usage patterns? Who is our audience?</p><p>開始討論技術的細節之前，我想先從產品的角度來談這個選舉報導專題：我們必須思考我們讀者所最關注的東西、閱讀習慣和他們的背景。按照這些需求，我們設計的頁面是左側的表格與右側的地圖互相連動。上方是整體的總統或立委選情。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Election Tracker Devices" width="1920" height="600" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-2.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-2.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-2.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-2.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>For starters, we expected that 80% of our readers would be accessing our content from a mobile device, and the large majority would be looking for Chinese content, although we would also make a version for our English readers. We knew that we wanted to display the results as close to realtime as we possible could, and knew that we wanted to cover presidential, district legislators, party legislators, and indigenous legislators. We also knew that we wanted to create an experience that gave readers content for before, during, and after the election, and to make content that could be built upon and referenced in the future.</p><p>第一個考量是我們預期 80% 的讀者會用手機看我們的開票網站，再者，雖然大部分讀者是中文使用者，但也會有英文的讀者對台灣大選有興趣。我們也知道頁面需要最即時的資訊，包含總統、分區立委、不分區立委和原住民立委。而且我們也知道給讀者的體驗不只是選舉開票的過程，在選舉之前跟之後的資訊都很重要。另外，我們也想做出一些未來還可以持續沿用的元件。這開票網站總共花了差不多兩個月的時間完整。包含的團隊主要是一位工程師和一位設計師。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png" class="kg-image" alt width="1948" height="1040" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-01-24-14.34.45.png 1948w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>To begin, we launched our election coverage by doing an aggregation of political polls in Taiwan, giving readers a more holistic view of trends of support for each of the presidential candidates. This not only gave us a way to promote our election coverage, but also gave us a way to test our new, Svelte-based system for building interactive articles and work out some of the kinks before election day. In total, building this tracker took us about two months, with a dedicated engineer and designer working nearly full time on this project.</p><p>我們首先製作的選舉專題，是台灣民意調查結果的綜合呈現，讓我們的讀者能比較完整地了解每位候選人的支持度與支持度的變化趨勢。這個民調專題不但讓我們多增加一個方式推播相關的選舉報導，也讓我們在選舉之前可以測試數位報導的新系統。（下面有補充我們用的 Svelte 框架）</p><h2 id="maps">Maps</h2><h2 id="--1">地圖</h2><p>Given that the main interaction users make with the election tracker is through the map, the map had to be responsive to user interaction and data updates. To allow users to explore as much of the data as possible, we decided that our map would at have three different layers to interact with.</p><p>因為我們的開票頁面中，與使用者最重要的互動是透過地圖的方式，所以我們的地圖一定要有很好的操作體驗，更新資料的反應要迅速。為了讓讀者能夠探索最大量的資料，我們決定頁面的地圖資訊需要分成三個不同層次。</p><p>The topmost layer is the whole country, including the outer islands that are part of Taiwan’s jurisdiction, followed by 22 counties (縣市). Each of the 22 counties can be further divided into towns (鄉鎮區), and the smallest unit of locality which we did not display is the village (里).</p><p>最上層是全台灣的圖層，用 22 個縣市來呈現。各個縣市的下一圖層是鄉鎮區。而我們決定不要分到里的層級，因為我們怕讀者會搞不清，現在他在哪一層。</p><p>All of this map data is obtained from <a href="https://data.gov.tw/dataset/7438">Taiwan’s government website</a> in the form of a 114MB shapefile. Obviously, if we were to directly convert the shapefile to topojson (a format for browsers to draw maps, more on this later), we’d still be looking at a file that is ~90MB in size; far too big to have every user download to their device.</p><p>地圖圖資的原始檔案是<a href="https://data.gov.tw/dataset/7438" rel="noopener nofollow">台灣政府提供的 shapefile</a>。很明顯地，如果我們直接把這個檔案轉到 topojson 給 D3 畫地圖，檔案大小大約 90 MB，這麼大的檔案會下載太久，也會影響網站呈現的效能。</p><p>Moreover, the map needs to be processed for special areas (areas that are part of Taiwan’s jurisdiction but may not be part of an official locality, such as 釣魚台) and relocation of the outer islands so that Kinmen and Lienchiang don’t make the map look too big. At first, I processed a few topojson files using QGIS and the shapefile obtained from the government, but after many failed attempts, (ie incorrect island relocation, missing districts, resulting file too large, too many details removed from the map during compression, etc) I decided to create an API endpoint that would process the map that I want on the fly.</p><p>還有一個考量是我們的地圖必須把特殊的地區整理出來，有一些屬於台灣控制但被管制沒有人居住的地方，例如釣魚台。地圖還需要把金門和連江移到離本島近一點，不然台灣地圖中間都會是海。一開始的時候，我手動用 QGIS 產生一些 topojson 的檔案，但因為每次做的都有一點不對（外島移的地方不太對、地區不對、檔案還是太大、壓縮的太過度等等），最後我決定用程式依據設定即時產生 topojson 地圖。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="Dynamic Map Code" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-8.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-8.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-8.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-8.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In essence, the API endpoint takes a few parameters:</p><ul><li>Map Version: Due to the fact that these borders will change based on redistricting or otherwise, I wanted to future-proof this API by allowing future maps to be easily versioned by year.</li><li>Locality Depth: Do we want the borders of the county, town, village, or district?</li><li>Specific Locality: Do we want the borders of a specific county, town, village, or district?</li><li>Simplification Level: How simplified do we want the resulting JSON file to be? More simplification and quantization means smaller file sizes but also a loss of detail.</li><li>Condensation of Outer Islands: Do we want a map where Kinmen and Lienchiang are where they are geographically or do we want to see them closer to mainland Taiwan?</li></ul><p>基本上，這個 API 有幾個設定：</p><ul><li>地圖版本：因為台灣地區的邊界是變動的，我的系統必須能按照年度去抓不一樣的地圖。</li><li>地區層級：我們的地圖要縣市、鄉鎮、里還是選區的邊界線？</li><li>特定的地區：我們只要某一個地區的地圖嗎？</li><li>壓縮程度：我們想要把地圖簡化和壓縮到什麼程度？雖然簡化會產出更小的檔案，但地圖細節也會相對變少。</li><li>外島移動：我們要不要把金門和連江移到比較靠近本島的地方？</li></ul><p>However, because legislative districts are not exactly correlated to any one of the existing locales, we had to separately process all of the locales of each of the legislative districts. Because a whole day of searching could not turn up a shapefile for Taiwan’s legislative districts, we decided to create the map ourselves based on which counties, towns, or villages, belonged to which district.</p><p>然而，因為區域立委的選區劃分跟我們上面提的地圖地區不一樣，所以我們需要額外去處理選區的地圖圖層。在政府的網站找了老半天，都沒找到選區的地圖，所以就只好自己依據中選會公布的選區劃分資料來做一個選區的地圖。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Custom Map Making" width="2150" height="600" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-3.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-3.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-3.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-3.png 2150w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="svg-vs-canvas">SVG vs Canvas</h3><h3 id="-svg-canvas-">必須考慮 SVG 的缺點， Canvas 的優點</h3><p>After constructing a reliable way to generate our topojson, the next question was figuring out how to display it in our browser. The naive approach is to <a href="https://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-1-897aa8f8ca2c">simply render the topojson to a SVG</a>. However, the problem with this is that SVGs use the DOM, which means that changes or user interactions with a complex SVG is slow and resource intensive. Add locale labels and mouse interactions and suddenly your SVG implementation slows to a crawl.</p><p>做完我們產生地圖的方式之後，我們下一個問題是怎麼顯示到瀏覽器裡。其實如果很<a href="https://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-1-897aa8f8ca2c" rel="noopener">單純得把 topojson 直接用 D3 顯示 SVG 是很容易</a>，但用 SVG 對效能不是很好。因為 SVG 用的是瀏覽器的 DOM，這變成每次跟地圖互動或者更新資料時，都要用 DOM 去更新。再加上地區的標籤與滑鼠的互動，網頁就會突然變得很慢。</p><p>The alternative is to use a canvas for display and an invisible SVG for interaction. This allows us to avoid expensive DOM operations of maintaining and manipulating the color of each locale on the map and instead use the canvas API to paint our map, while maintaining a SVG just to keep track of when users interact. In my very unscientific benchmarking on my own machine, I found that SVGs needed to be about twice a simplified compared to canvas in order to achieve similar performance. More about <a href="https://observablehq.com/@rdmurphy/combining-html-canvas-svg-flatbush-for-super-efficient-hov">this method here</a>.</p><p>效能比較好的作法是用 canvas 顯示，但用 SVG 接互動的事件。這個做法可以避免 DOM 因為計算每一個不同地區的顏色和位置而變慢。大略的實驗之後，我發現用這種做法大約可以提昇兩倍的效能。如果想要更深入了解這個做法，<a href="https://observablehq.com/@rdmurphy/combining-html-canvas-svg-flatbush-for-super-efficient-hov" rel="noopener nofollow">可以參考這個教學</a>。</p><p>The optimizations that I could have done on the map are endless. If we were to further optimize the map, I would recommend using some kind of WebGL implementation, potentially <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">MapboxGL</a> to make map rendering performance even better, but a canvas approach was good enough for this use case.</p><p>如果還有更多的時間，其實還可以繼續地優化我們的地圖，例如使用一種 WebGL 的套件、<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/" rel="noopener nofollow">MapboxGL</a> 等等，但我覺得這個專題用 Canvas 就夠好了。</p><h2 id="data-pipeline">Data Pipeline</h2><h2 id="--2">資料流程</h2><p>The data for our election tracker was obtained from the Central Election Committee, which gives us a 3MB JSON file of all the data anytime it is updated. Because this JSON file is so large and can take up to 5 seconds to download from the Central Election Committee, we decided to only fetch it at a regular cadence and process / store it into a database we can control and scale.</p><p>因為我們的資料來源是中選會，每次串入的資料是一個 3MB 的 JSON 檔案。因為檔案尺寸這麼大，有時候會需要到五秒的時間才能完成下載，所以我們決定用 cronjob 一分鐘取一次，然後存在我們自己的資料庫裡（Google Datastore）。這樣我們才比較能應對網站的高流量。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="Data Pipeline" width="2650" height="1080" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-9.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-9.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-9.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/Artboard-9.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>To do this, we used a cron job that would fetch the latest data from the Central Election Committee every minute, and separate out presidential and legislative results before storing it into Google Datastore.</p><p>然後為了讓編輯們能加上當選註記，我們開了一個 Google Spreadsheet 讓編輯填寫。這個 Spreadsheet 直接連到我們的系統。這個做法後來有出問題，我會在下面一段解釋。</p><p>Then, in order to indicate when a candidate has won, we connected a Google Spreadsheet that allowed our editors to manually mark when a race had been won. The system would then use that data to display the winner on the frontend. As it turns out, this became a problem on the night of the election, which I expand more on in the “lessons learned” section.</p><h2 id="election-rules-edge-cases">Election Rules Edge Cases</h2><h2 id="--3">選舉規則特殊狀況</h2><p>In terms of electoral rules, Taiwan follows a simple majority-wins policy for electing it’s president, which is easy to display on a map. However, legislative races follow a fairly complex system:</p><ul><li>Taiwan’s legislature has a total of 113 seats.</li><li>73 district legislators are elected through a majority-wins policy for each of the 73 designated districts of Taiwan.</li><li>34 party legislators are elected through a party-vote system, in which voters vote on a party, and all parties that obtain over 5% of the overall vote get to assign legislators based on the proportion of votes they receive. The legislators of a party elected through this system must be &gt;50% female, according to the order they are ranked in their party list.</li><li>6 indigenous legislators are elected by two three-member constituencies, picking the top three legislators for each plains and highlands indigenous constituencies.</li></ul><p>台灣選總統是最高票數的候選人贏，這種規則很容易被顯示在地圖上。但是，選立委的規則很複雜，要用地圖呈現是一個蠻大的挑戰：</p><ul><li>台灣立委總共有 113 席。</li><li>73 席是分區立委，總共有 73 選區選出各個選區的最高票數候選人。</li><li>34 席是不分區立委，投給各個政黨。政黨票超過總票數 5% 的政黨，會按照比例去分配這 34 席。但是用這個方法選上的候選人，有女性保證名額，必須超過50% 是女性。</li><li>6 席的原住民立委中，3 席給山地原住民，3 席給平地原住民。</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-6.png" class="kg-image" alt width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-6.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-6.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-6.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-6.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This logic poses a few challenges. First of all, the topmost level we can display for district legislators is the district itself, because we can’t calculate the color for a county that has multiple districts with different races.</p><p>這些邏輯要怎麼呈現呢？首先，分區立委能夠呈現的最高層不是縣市，因為一個縣市如果有多個選區，你沒辦法在無關的選區選出哪一個政黨領先，所以最高層只能顯示各個選區的地圖。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-5.png" class="kg-image" alt width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-5.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-5.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-5.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-5.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Second, because indigenous legislature races elect the top three candidates for each plains and highlands indigenous groups, simply coloring a district with the party of the first-place candidate does not reflect the true breakdown of the vote. Thus, we decided to take the top three candidates and add up the votes based on their political parties, then take the color of the party with the most votes.</p><p>第二，因為原住民立委是山地和平地各選出最高票的三位，我們不能直接用最高票的候選人去呈現一個地區，因為這不見得真正代表一個選區的支持。我們討論到後來決定把前三高票按照政黨加起來，然後再選最高票政黨的顏色去呈現。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-4.png" class="kg-image" alt width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-4.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-4.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-4.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-4.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Third, because of the gender rule for party votes, legislators of a party that get elected through this method do not necessarily correspond with the order that they are placed in the party list. As a result, we have to build an algorithm to determine skip over the next male legislator in the list if there are already too many men.</p><p>第三，因為不分區立委有女性保證名額，每個政黨所排得不分區席次順序，不一定是選上席次的順序。因此，我們再特別寫一個邏輯來判斷什麼時候需要跳過男性的立委，以滿足因為那個政黨選上的女性比例。</p><h2 id="post-election-graphics">Post-Election Graphics</h2><h2 id="--4">選後圖表</h2><p>Another large element of our election coverage was the graphics that we post to social media such as Facebook and Instagram. Because we wanted to be able to generate social media optimized graphics as fast as possible, we needed a method faster than designers plugging in election results into graphic. To achieve this, we built an internal website that would dynamically generate SVGs with the latest data from the Central Election Committee.</p><p>我們選舉專題另外一個很大的部分是要提供在網站、FB 和 IG 要發布的圖表。如果等到選舉之後才請設計師出資訊圖表，他們一定會做得又趕又累。因此，我們寫了一個內部用的網站，可以即時用中選會的資料產生他們事先設計好的圖表。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-7.png" class="kg-image" alt="Dynamic Graphic Generation" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Artboard-7.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Artboard-7.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Artboard-7.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/Artboard-7.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>To achieve this, designers would first come up with the design of the graphics in the form of an adobe illustrator document. Then we took those graphics and exported each one into a separate SVG. Because SVG files are a XML-based specification, we can port these into our web application in order to make content within the SVG dynamic.</p><p>我們的流程是先把設計師設計的圖表輸出成 SVG。因為 SVG 只是一個 XML 類型的檔案，我們可以很容易用網頁框架動態地產生 SVG。用 SVG 這樣操作的好處是用什麼程式語言或框架都可以。在我們的用途中，是將產出的 SVG 設定為可以下載成 SVG 以及PNG 兩種檔案。</p><p>The great thing about using SVGs in this way is that it is language and tool agnostic, which means you can use whatever existing templating language / framework you use to generate these graphics. In our case, we fitted it into an internal website that the social media team can directly access to download the generated SVG or a PNG format to be posted on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.</p><h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h2><h2 id="--5">系統監控</h2><p>Another critical piece of election-preparedness was making sure that we knew everything that was happening with our web application at all times. To monitor the health of the application and make sure that everything scaled properly, we set up a grafana dashboard that kept track of server errors, response latency, upstream API connections, cache hit ratios, as well as the standard CPU, memory, and database metrics.</p><p>另一個很重要的準備是確定我們隨時都能知道系統健不健康，這樣我們才能夠在出事時，有更快的反應。為了系統監控，我們在 Kubernetes Cluster 上運用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 紀錄錯誤、回答速度、往外連線、cache hit 率和比較基本的 CPU、memory 和 DB 等等的資訊。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Grafana Monitoring" width="1919" height="938" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/DSC04709.jpg 1919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>By having the web application directly report metrics to prometheus, it was much easier to get the fine grained metrics specific to elections that we cared about. Because we had taken the time to integrate key metrics into prometheus, when errors began to show up during the election, we were able to immediately know what was causing the error.</p><p>把 prometheus 的資訊套在程式上可以比較容易監控一些客製化的資訊。選舉當天 Google spreadsheet 出問題的時候，我們因為有套 prometheus ，所以馬上就知道是 Google 那邊的問題。</p><h2 id="svelte">Svelte</h2><h2 id="--6">紐約時報開發的前端框架</h2><p>Although React has been possibly the most popular front-end framework to use these days, one of the questions I find interesting to ask during interviews is “Under what circumstances is React not a good framework to use? When would you recommend not using React?” This is a question that stumps many less-experienced engineers and people without a good grasp of what React really does in the browser under the hood. In fact, I believe that there are many situations under which React is not a good choice, and building interactives in a news environment is one of them.</p><p>最近在前端工程師的世界裡 React 變得很紅，但我最近常常很喜歡問的問題是「怎麼樣的狀況之下你覺得 React 不適合？什麼時候會建議不要用 React 開發一個專案？」這是一個需要比較有經驗的前端工程師才能回答的問題。我認為有很多狀況下 React 不適合。而媒體的特殊數位報導就是其中一個。</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/svelte.png" class="kg-image" alt width="712" height="300" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/svelte.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/svelte.png 712w"></figure><p>News organizations have a very different development and deployment cycle than tech companies do, requiring tighter deadlines, faster feedback loops, and more bespoke flexibility. Thus, I decided to use <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, giving us the following main advantages among many:</p><ul><li>Development speed: Given the amount of work to be done within a short amount of time, I decided that Svelte would be much faster to write than React, giving faster development and feedback times. Using Sapper with Svelte would also allow me to write the server-side data APIs quickly and easily.</li><li>Bundled JS Size: Because Svelte runs as a compiler, it’s able to build and include only the code that your applications needs, making the compiled bundle much smaller than a React application.</li></ul><p>新聞對數位報導的開發需求，需要更優雅的程式設計去即時地傳遞與回應訊息，這是一件非常有挑戰性的事情。因此，我這次開發即時開票頁面使用的框架是 <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow">Svelte</a>。為什麼要選擇用 Svelte，它有哪裡比 React 好？</p><ul><li>開發速度。Svelte 大致上比 React 要寫的程式碼少 ～30%。這個聽起來可能沒有很多，但 30% 的差別也代表 30% 的效率。</li><li>程式大小。因為 Svelte 是一個 Compiler，最終寫完的程式碼檔案很小，因為他只會打包你的程式所需要的東西。</li></ul><p>If you’re interested in learning more about Svelte, there are many <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics">tutorials to help you get started</a>.</p><p>如果你有興趣學 Svelte，這裏<a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics" rel="noopener nofollow">有很多</a>可以參考的教學。</p><h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2><h2 id="--7">學到的心得</h2><h3 id="load-test">Load Test</h3><h3 id="--8">壓力測試</h3><p>The biggest problem we saw on election night was that the site was down for ~1 hour due to high traffic. Specifically, it wasn’t the servers on our end that could not take the traffic, it was our usage of Google Sheets that caused Google to lock our google spreadsheet when the flow of traffic became too large. After Google locked out requests to the spreadsheet, our system started responding to downstream users with 500 errors, causing the entire site to be inoperable.</p><p>我們在選舉當天遇到關鍵評論網的最高流量。這個高流量造成網站有差不多一小時的時間沒辦法使用。而問題是出在我們打 Google Spreadsheets 的流量太高，導致 Google 把我們的 Spreadsheet 封鎖，所以我們的 API 一開始有很大量的錯誤訊息。</p><p>The solution was to first disconnect the spreadsheet from our services, which brought both our service and the google spreadsheet back online. Then, we implemented a quick function that would prevent the service from requesting data from the google spreadsheet so often. This brought everything back online.</p><p>排除這個問題的第一步，是把我們系統跟 Google Spreadsheet 的連線斷開，讓 Google Spreadsheet 回復到正常。接下來，我們加了一個很簡單的邏輯，讓我們的程式不要那麼常去打 Google Spreadsheet。這個作法使我們的系統回復到正常狀態。</p><p>The lesson here is that, unless you fully load test your entire system before the election, you never know what problems will be caused when traffic increases by a few orders of magnitude. Often, third-party services such as Google Docs will have their own unwritten throughput and bandwidth limits.</p><p>這個事件讓我們學到的是，你永遠不知道高流量可能會造成什麼樣的問題，而你也需要完整地做一個壓力測試，你才能知道第三方服務會有可能出現什麼樣的問題。</p><h3 id="have-a-clear-incident-response-plan">Have a Clear Incident Response Plan</h3><h3 id="--9">規劃一個明確的反應流程</h3><p>No matter how much planning you do in preparation of the big day, incidents are always likely to happen and things will never go exactly according to plan. That said, after you’ve made all the preparation you can possibly make, the next important thing to plan for is how to respond when things do not go as plan. In our case, by dividing up responsibilities we had a basic level of responsibilities when things went awry, but it would have been more advantageous to rehearse a few scenarios.</p><p>不論你做了多少準備，當下發生的事情通常都會跟你預設的不一樣。這代表你做完所有能夠想像的情況準備之後，你還要預設一個當事件發生時的反應流程。這個流程包含跑一些練習，預設誰負責溝通，誰負責修問題。這兩個角色一定需要準備，因為修問題的人需要專心的修問題，沒辦法同時跟大家回報現在的狀況。</p><p>Namely, when the site goes down, it is important to define who will fix the problem and who will report the status to the rest of the team. It is hard for one person to do both, lest the person trying to fix the problem becomes bombarded with too many inquiries about the current status and is unable to concentrate on fixing the problem.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2><h2 id="--10">專案結論</h2><p>In conclusion, I hope the process we used and the lessons we learned can be built upon by the community, allowing future elections and similar events to be faster, more efficient, and better experiences for our readers and our organizations. I’m sure that our processes will continue to evolve, and I hope we can continue to learn better workflows and collaboration processes.</p><p>我希望我們在關鍵評論遇到的經驗可以幫助大家的思考，讓以後的選舉我們都可以給讀者更好的閱讀體驗。我也希望我們的流程會不斷的進步，讓我們能繼續分享我們學到的東西。</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next to a stand of dragonfruit, durian, guavas, lychee, and mangosteen on the corner of Main Street and 41st Rd, a nondescript door presents itself in a drab, frosted white. Above the door the words “Golden Shopping Mall” appear in a golden sans-serif font, which are the only clues that through the door and down the stairs lie culinary gems of New York City.</p><p>Downstairs, you’ll find Tianjin Dumpling House, Lan Zhou Noodles, and the original Xian’s Famous Foods, all cramped into a tiny, poorly ventilated space. We all have our vices – mine include the lamb dumplings from Tianjin Dumpling House, which I’ve always kept a bag of sitting in my freezer. They’re plump, juicy, thicc, and life-changing.</p><p>New York City. A city that has attracted immigrants from around the world for a million different reasons, where a cacophony of languages, cultures, and experiences harmonize. Flushing represents an experience of Asian-America that shares cultural roots yet is different in every other way from my hometown of Cupertino. As I’ve gotten to know Asian-Americans who grew up in Queens, our conversations have uncovered stories of children who had to translate for their parents at a young age or hide in work closets because there wasn’t enough money for childcare.</p><p>My grandparents came to the United States with roughly enough money to buy a dining table and a TV, stopping in Flushing for less than a year before moving to Houston where they live today. In a recent conversation with my grandma, she told me about the restaurant on Main Street where she would buy roast duck during the first six months they spent in the States as they learned English. Today, scenes of the immigrant work ethic are still visible in Flushing, where new immigrants continue to live the life that my grandparents experienced thirty years ago.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg" class="kg-image" alt width="4048" height="3036" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20180210_171604.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Down the little alley known as 40th Road is Shanghai You Garden, where they make soup dumplings by hand in the front of the restaurant for all to see, reminding me of Taiwan’s legendary Din Tai Fung. Walk a few doors down and you’ll find Yifang Taiwan Fruit Tea, a gem of Taiwan’s most notorious culinary export: boba.</p><p>There’s no contest when it comes to two types of foods that I will never tire of: noodles and tacos. Despite what the average New Yorker may believe, New York City is a medieval backwater when it comes to tacos – sure you have Los Tacos #1, but anyone who’s had any random taco truck in Los Angeles can tell you that Los Tacos is merely passable in comparison. When it comes to noodles, however, New York’s got an endless variety: Singapore Laksa, Khao Soy, Beef Noodle Soup, Bun Bo Hue, Biang Biang Noodles from places like Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles, Taste Good Malaysian Cuisine, Dun Huang Beef Noodle, and so on.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg" class="kg-image" alt width="4048" height="2544" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20180624_145920.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It’s been almost three months since I’ve left New York City, but I still get flashbacks of the anticipation on 7 train between Mets-Willets Point and Flushing Main St. Or the time that, upon finishing an episode of Parts Unknown at 11pm, my friend and I ventured into the cold for the same living octopus that we just watched Bourdain eat on TV. I’ve tried so many new cuisines in New York City – Sichuan, Colombian, Greek, Uyghur, Tibetan, Brazilian, Malaysian, all without venturing more than a few subway stops from my apartment in Queens.</p><p>I’d love to say that every place I’ve tried in New York has been nothing short of stellar, but the reality is quite the opposite: for every place that has left me with a new appreciation for a certain type of noodle, meat, or vegetable, many others have left me disappointed or unsatisfied. I’ll never understand why New York City has a disproportionately high number of mediocre and expensive ramen restaurants, or the poke shops that are more pleasing to the instagram than the taste buds.</p><p>I think back on it now with a kind of nostalgic Stockholm Syndrome. Faded are the irritations of getting to see sunlight for mere minutes everyday, fighting for personal space on a subway train with a broken AC, and the city noises that never shut up. These days, I’m soaking up all California has to offer by wandering through the desert, the forest, the mountains, or the beaches, wondering how I ever was able to function in such an excessive concrete jungle. The food certainly made it more stomachable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 24th, Taiwan elections saw a resurgence of KMT (Kuomintang, 國民黨) backed candidates, after a few years of nearly total control by the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party, 民進黨). The results came as a surprise to many people, even those who already expected this election to be a rebuke to president Tsai Ing-Wen's (蔡英文) two years in power. On the ballot were the mayors for all cities in Taiwan, thousands of councillors, local representatives, and ten referendum questions.</p><p>The shift in power back toward the KMT was not the only thing that indicated a mobilization of more conservative voters. Every single referendum question that progressives rallied behind was voted down, including questions supporting marriage equality and a participation in the Olympics as Taiwan instead of Chinese Taipei.</p><p>Now that the election has happened, let's dive into the data to get a better picture of what actually happened and what this means for Taiwan and the world.</p><h2 id="mayoral-elections">Mayoral Elections</h2><p>To begin, let's start by taking a look at the mayoral elections across the country. Taiwan's mayoral elections are closely watched as they are considered to be similar in importance to a gubernatorial election in the US.</p><p><em>(Hover over a district to explore. Blue districts indicate a KMT mayoral victory, green districts indicate a DPP mayoral victory, and grey districts indicate a third party mayoral victory. Striped districts indicate a change in party from the 2014 election.)</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="taiwan extended"></div>

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3";
(new Runtime).module(define, name => {
  if (name === "taiwan") return Inspector.into(".taiwan")();
});
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The first thing that is made apparent in this map is how much blue there is. But as is with any election map, geographical space is an inaccurate representation of population. That is to say that much of the central and eastern areas of Taiwan are sparsely populated.</p><p>However, closer inspection of the map reveals a few interesting points. First, there are far more blue striped districts than green striped districts, indicating that while many districts in Taichung (台中) and Kaohsiung (高雄) flipped blue, some districts in Taoyuan (桃園) actually flipped green. Hualien (花蓮) county is striped because it went from an independent county mayor to a KMT one. That Taichung flipped back to blue is no surprised, as Taichung is historically more blue than green.</p><h2 id="kaohsiung-">Kaohsiung (高雄)</h2><p>Perhaps the most closely watched mayoral election of the night was that of the city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city. In all of Taiwan's history as a two party democracy, Kaohsiung has consistently and reliably been under control of the DPP, making this year's KMT victory for Han Kuo-Yu (韓國瑜) a major surprise.</p><p>By all counts, Han Kuo-Yu was a candidate that came out of relative obscurity into the public spotlight as he campaigned to become Kaohsiung's mayor. He is a second-generation "mainlander" (a group that arrived in Taiwan during China's civil war) from New Taipei City (新北市) on the north end of Taiwan.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="kaohsiung extended"></div>

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";

(new Runtime).module(define, name => {
  if (name === "kaohsiung") return Inspector.into(".kaohsiung")();
});
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As we can see in this map, Han Kuo-Yu successfully flipped a large majority of the districts in Kaohsiung, giving him the nickname "han wave" (寒流, or maybe 韓流).</p><h2 id="taipei-">Taipei (台北)</h2><p>Taipei was another closely watched election for a separate reason. Similar to Han Kuo-Yu's victory in Kaohsiung, Ko Wen-Jie (柯文哲) shocked the nation when he won the mayor's election in Taipei in 2014. Despite the apparent similarities between Ko Wen-Jie and Han Kuo-Yu, Ko is notable additionally for being the first to win an election as Taipei's mayor as an independent.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="taipei extended"></div>

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3";
(new Runtime).module(define, name => {
  if (name === "taipei") return Inspector.into(".taipei")();
});
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In this year's election, Ko was reelected by less than 3,000 votes, leaving the election much closer than most people expected. A likely explanation for this is that in 2014 Ko received endorsement from the DPP, who did not put a candidate into the race. But in 2018, unhappy with Ko in his first term, the DPP ran Pasuya Yao (姚文智) as a protest against Ko, likely cannibalizing his votes.</p><h2 id="referendum-questions">Referendum Questions</h2><p>On the ballot this year were also ten referendum questions. The current manifestation of referendum system was created legislatively in December of 2017 by the DPP, making the barrier of entry to citizens directly running referendums much easier by lowering the threshold for submitting. Interestingly, the decreased barrier of entry to running a referendum likely backfired politically on the DPP, with all of the positions supported by conservatives passing, while none of the positions supported by progressives passed.</p><p><em>(Hover over each map to see the question and the voting results. Yellow districts indicate a majority "yes" vote and red districts indicate a majority "no" vote)</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="referendum extended"></div>

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";

(new Runtime).module(define, name => {
  if (name === "referendum") return Inspector.into(".referendum")();
});
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Looking at the data, it's apparent that most referendum questions went nearly unanimously yes or no, with question number 13 regarding the olympics causing the closest vote.</p><blockquote>Do you agree to the use of “Taiwan” when participating in all international sport competitions, including the upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics?</blockquote><p>If we take a closer look at the way that people voted on this question, you'll notice that the "yes" votes seem to cluster around Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Yilan. Despite the fact that large amounts of the electorate in Kaohsiung turned out in support of the KMT candidate Han Kuo-Yu, it appears that many of them still voted for referendum question 13. One way to interpret this may not be that perspectives in Kaohsiung are becoming more favorable of KMT causes, but that Han Kuo-Yu's populist approach successfully motivated the city.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="referendum13 extended"></div>

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";

(new Runtime).module(define, name => {
  if (name === "referendum13") return Inspector.into(".referendum13")();
});
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="turnout">Turnout</h2><p>Another very interesting factor to consider is how people turned out. There are many similarities between the 2014 local election and the recent 2018 local election. Just as the results of the 2018 election are seen as a backlash to Tsai Ing-Wen, the results of 2014 election can similarly be considered a backlash to the previous president Ma Ying-Jeou (馬英九). Although the overall voter turnout in this election was higher than 2014, it is apparent that different districts turned out differently.</p><p><em>(Purple districts indicate an increase in voter turnout compared to 2014, and red districts indicate a decrease in voter turnout. Voter turnout in this section is calculated by votes for mayor in 2014 and 2018)</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="turnout extended"></div>

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3";
(new Runtime).module(define, name => {
  if (name === "turnout") return Inspector.into(".turnout")();
});
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We can look at this graph as an indication of who turned out in each election. Across the board, turnout was lower in Taipei, Tainan, and Taichung, while higher in Kaohsiung. As discussed above, we saw an increase in turnout in Kaohsiung likely because of Han Kuo-Yu.</p><p>Overall, 12,507,779 people voted in 2018 compared to 12,261,784 people in 2014. The increased turnout was most apparent in Kaohsiung and New Taipei City. Here's another way to look at this data.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="turnoutGraph extended"></div>

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-elections-2018-visualized.js?v=3";
(new Runtime).module(define, name => {
  if (name === "turnoutGraph") return Inspector.into(".turnoutGraph")();
});
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Despite voter turnout being higher in aggregate, we notice that voter turnout decreased in the capital city of Taipei. One explanation of lower turnout in Taipei was that this year's ballot took longer to fill out and Taipei precincts were flooded with voters, the majority of whom waited hours in order to vote. The increased waiting time was likely a deterrent for individuals who were unable to wait that long.</p><p>Returning to the referendum results, it's also plausible that the way districts turned out caused the referendum questions to lean more conservative. The fact that many of the urban cores (except for Kaohsiung) saw a decrease in turnout likely contributes to this result.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>There's no doubt that Taiwan is a vibrant, dynamic, and messy democracy. Under the looming threat of Chinese annexation, Taiwan remains fervently committed to its democracy in stark contrast to its authoritarian neighbor across the strait. Just like democracies anywhere in the world, electorates are never a monolith. There are nuances within nuances of individual politics, and explorations like these only begin to scratch the surface.</p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><p>Voting results data fetched from the <a href="http://vote.2018.nat.gov.tw/pc/zh_TW/index.html">Central Election Committee</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always interpreted the Second Amendment very literally: a provision that allows citizens of the United States the right to own firearms. But in a recent conversation with a startup founder, he suggested that it could also be interpreted to include digital encryption as a kind of modern weapon for self defense.</p><p>I’m no lawyer or constitutional historian, but even if that snippet of legalese cannot be stretched to protect privacy via methods of digital encryption, the thought illustrates how far we’ve come from the world that the framers of the constitution imagined while writing the initial governance for our country. The regulatory debates of our current social-political landscapes would fly over the heads of even the most forward-thinking founding fathers.</p><p>The freedom of assembly, listed right next to freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the First Amendment, is a provision guaranteed by our nation that protects the right of individuals to peacefully assemble for any reason or circumstance. Throughout America’s history, grassroots assembly has empowered individuals to organize and protest, enabling much of the change that has happened in American history.</p><p>Today, digital communications has become the medium for much of the organizing that formerly took place by physical assembly, stretching the concept of assembly beyond merely physical convenings. In this world, encryption becomes a vital part of giving people the ability to speak freely. In that sense, I’d argue that encryption has more to do with the First Amendment than the second, despite encryption not being mentioned anywhere in the original constitution.</p><p>It is this type of modern refactoring that lends itself to a constant need to rethink and refine our systems of government, technology, and social relations. But while every era presents a different set of complex challenges, it would be naive to assert that this notion of political change is new or uniquely of our time. From the renaissance to global colonization to world wars to the internet and every little thing in between, people have debated the very nature of how political and regulatory systems have functioned in a way that I will call “technocratic political innovation”.</p><p>By “technocratic”, I don’t mean someone who is leading with the intent of increasing the implementation of digital devices and systems, I mean someone with a scientific, quantitative, and research driven approach to improve outcomes in a political system. In this sense, thinkers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville" rel="noopener noreferrer">de Tocqueville</a> could potentially be considered technocratic, even if they would call a modern smartphone some kind of witchcraft.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/1318034247206.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Arab Spring" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/1318034247206.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/1318034247206.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/1318034247206.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There’s no doubt that technology is a powerful tool for organizing and taking action. We’ve seen how things like social media and digital communications have been critical infrastructure in instances such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring" rel="noopener noreferrer">widely hailed Arab Spring</a>. If we’re not careful, however, it’s easy to give too much credit to social media for the success of political movements that resulted from hundreds of thousands of people organizing and establishing their movement. And as much as social media has the power to unite, it has in certain cases also isolated us from the very movements we seek to partake in. Social media accelerates globalization in a way that connects me to similar people around the world while distancing me from the waiter at the restaurant I had lunch at.</p><p>Faulting social media platforms for ignorant bubbles isn’t entirely fair. People lived in filter bubbles long before the internet ever existed. However, social media is causing an upheaval in the way our filter bubbles operate without explicitly intending to.</p><blockquote>If social media unintentionally reconfigured our filter bubbles to break down physical distance at the expense of increasing digital distance, civic media is an intentional effort to counteract the growing distance between people.</blockquote><p>All over the world, pockets of people are prototyping new ways of digital civic participation in hopes to be successful enough to scale across an entire party, city, or a nation. The term hacktivism has been recently popularized to describe this sort of activism, across a spectrum from anonymous digital vigilantes to publicly-funded digital governance efforts. While hacktivists around the world may not be of the same political leanings, languages, or belief systems, hacktivism is a force that is only increasing in use internationally, and choosing to ignore these movements is choosing to ignore an increasingly potent force in global politics.</p><p>The drastic changes in technology and media are only going to amplify and accelerate the pace of change in our modern political establishment, propelling us into more global uncertainty. With the election of Donald Trump and populists around the world, not only are traditional politicians likely an endangered class of individuals, an even stronger wave of Millennials and Gen-Zers are waiting to one day inherit the power from today’s leaders.</p><p>It is a very crucial time in world history, and the stories of decisions made by tomorrow’s leaders today are going to have a greater impact than the decisions of today’s leaders today. <a href="http://www.ianbremmer.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Bremmer</a> talks about 2016 being a transition between a world led by the United States known as <a href="https://www.eurasiagroup.net/live-post/it-really-is-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Pax Americana” to being a world without a clear leader known as “G-Zero”</a>.</p><p>In a G-Zero world, no country or group of countries has the leverage to unilaterally champion a single worldview. In fact, a G-Zero world means that no two countries are on the same page in terms of economic, domestic, or foreign policy, leaving the world without a country that is able to advance a specific international agenda. And as the result of globalization, corporations are sitting on greater vaults of wealth, routing assets and finances through many countries with conflicting interests, causing certain countries that would otherwise be in stark conflicts to have a somewhat stable relationship.</p><p>One argument to explain why the European Union has been relatively free of conflict in the past few decades can be attributed to the EU, specifically the way that the euro has bound the european countries together economically. A similar argument could be made about the US and China: that the two countries are so interdependent that neither side is willing to risk a conflict for fear of repercussions in their own country.</p><p>However, the economics are not enough to prevent tensions between countries. As tensions continue to escalate both between and within countries, causing democratic upheavals such as the massive protests that are taking place in response to Trump’s election in the US, Park’s impeachment in South Korea, Erdogan’s eroding of democratic systems, history tells us that we have the conditions for significant changes likely started from single individuals or group of individuals.</p><p>But despite the fact that we’re currently witnessing an alarming number of nationalistic world leaders rise to power, people today are better prepared to face these leaders than we have ever been.</p><h2 id="the-historical-rise-of-non-state-actors">The Historical Rise of Non-State Actors</h2><p>The role of everyday individuals shaping the political direction runs in parallel with the technologies that everyday people have access to. Technology enables or inhibits the way that ideas are shared and movements are organized. Thus, to think that media and technology are separate is misguided; technology has always been about media, whether that be distributing an idea to as many people as possible or intentionally anonymizing and limiting who knows about something.</p><p>In 1969, an employee of RAND corporation named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Ellsberg</a> began making covert photocopies of classified documents about the Vietnam war. Being in an era before files were edited digitally, it took over the span of a year for Ellsberg to manually make copies of the documents in his off-work hours. As the news broke on June 13th, 1971, the story confirmed the suspicions people had that the government was more involved in Vietnam than they were publicly admitting.</p><p>Fast forward 40 years later, an intelligence analyst named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley Manning</a> was faced with a similar choice that Ellsberg faced: whether to leak documents that detailed US involvement abroad. However, the stark difference between Ellsberg and Manning was that it took Manning less than a day to copy out an archive of data hundreds of times larger than the Pentagon Papers, a cache that would have taken Ellsberg roughly 18 years to copy the way he copied the Pentagon Papers.</p><blockquote>Publishing, leaking, and whistleblowing have all become much more accessible from the time of the printing press to the internet, enabling anyone today to use cryptography and internet anonymity tools to avoid surveillance and sound the alarms on governments. Individuals such as Julian Assange can single-handedly create political nightmares for governments, forcing them to be accountable in public to the things they said privately.</blockquote><p>And Internet whistleblowing is just one example of how a small group of people are changing the way that governments and politicians operate. Just as the rise of internet media has caused print newspapers and journalists to completely change the way that they operate, it is also forcing groups to change of how they establish influence and power.</p><p>One of the most widely cited examples of the Internet’s role in political organizing has been the Arab Spring; where protests organized largely through digital tools radically impacted the relationship governments had with their citizens, including overthrowing leaders and other incumbent regimes. But around the world, the Arab Spring is only one example of how technology is being used by individuals to circulate ideas and incite political action.</p><h1 id="partido-de-la-red-democracyos-and-argentina"><strong><strong>Partido de la Red, DemocracyOS, and Argentina</strong></strong></h1><p>The Outerlands was just the kind of restaurant you’d expect to find in San Francisco. The decor consists of reclaimed wood and bare lightbulbs hanging in a way that is most-definitely more expensive than appears. Here, founders from all over the world are attracted to the prospect of starting their own technology company and achieve the now-cliche belief that they are “changing the world”.</p><p>Wearing a hoodie that is typical for Silicon Valley technology types, Santiago walked in after a morning of wrangling code for his new internet-democracy platform. Most stories of startup founders moving to Silicon Valley are similarly unique: as an outsider in their native environment, they made some sort of application or technology, got accepted to an accelerator in Silicon Valley such as YCombinator, and moved out to San Francisco.</p><p>Santiago fits right in in San Francisco: passionate about the potential for technology to impact incumbent processes, Santiago called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satoshi Nakamoto’s blockchain</a> the next great invention behind Gutenberg’s printing press and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Berners-Lee’s world wide web</a>. In fact, Santiago shared that he documented the birth of his daughter on a blockchain as a publicly permanent declaration of her birth.</p><p>But where Santiago stands out is in his history with political activism starting in his hometown of Buenos Aires. In 2012, Santiago started <a href="http://partidodelared.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Partido de la Red</a>, a political party in Buenos Aires that was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquid democracy</a>.</p><blockquote>To someone used to following American politics, starting a political party seems more difficult than landing a human on the moon.</blockquote><p>Traditionally dominated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peronism" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peronism</a>, opposing political parties in Argentina have had a long history playing second fiddle to the long-incumbent Peronist ideal that has won three-quarters of the presidential elections since it started in 1946. The Peronist ideal, rejecting both capitalism and communism, is not a political ideal easily captured by traditional western politics.</p><p>Since the ideals for Peronism were laid down in the 1940s, it’s flexibility in political views has allowed it to maintain dominance through a series of coups, martial law, corruption, political violence, and all the other things Argentina has gone through, much of which is still felt today. Walking through Plaza de Mayo, for instance, it’s hard to miss the white scarves painted on the ground as a symbol of the Mothers that would gather to protest state terrorism that kidnapped children without explanation.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20160925_154023.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Plaza de Mayo" width="1200" height="898" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20160925_154023.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20160925_154023.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20160925_154023.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Nevertheless, in an attempt to address corruption in the political system, the Net Party was founded by Santiago as a grassroots attempt to build a political system around the voice of the people, implementing a voting platform to allow citizens to essentially act as a digital parliament. By implementing <a href="http://democracyos.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DemocracyOS</a>, an internet platform for collecting votes from citizens, representatives from the Net Party are better able to legislate in accordance to their constituents.</p><p>Liquid democracy, also known as delegative democracy, is an idea that builds on the concept of every citizen being able to elect their representative. Through liquid democracy, citizens are able to vote by vesting power in delegates rather than representatives.</p><blockquote>The difference between a delegate and a representative is that the barrier to entry of becoming a delegate is much lower than that of becoming a representative, and that citizens can shift power between delegates much more easily than they can representatives. Such a system aims to give more flexibility to each citizen, allowing individuals to become more or less involved at their choosing, and being better able to keep delegates accountable.</blockquote><p>I visited the DemocracyOS office in Buenos Aires to learn more about the open source project. The office is about the size of a large living room, complete with a loft that adds a few more desks for people to work. Since it’s inception, DemocracyOS has been implemented by governments in Argentina, Brazil, Spain, France, Finland, Hungary, and Colombia.</p><p>During my visit to the DemocracyOS office, the CTO of DemocracyOS Guido Vilariño, walked me through the code powering DemocracyOS, as I made my first pull request into the Node.js powered application. The ease at which I am able to personally contribute to this project and so many around the world speaks to the interconnectedness of global communities, allowing projects such as DemocracyOS to draw from a global group of volunteers and developers.</p><p>To Guido, DemocracyOS describes a future he is working to see to fruition. In our wide ranging conversation, Guido spoke with a guided sense of pragmatism recognizing that progress toward change requires intentional compromises, even if that means DemocracyOS is not quite implemented according to his ideals. Everyone who is a part of the efforts for Partido de La Red and DemocracyOS share a belief that the internet is having and will have irreversible effects on politics, starting with their efforts in Buenos Aires.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a system like DemocracyOS existing prior to the internet, as the logistical challenge of maintaining a liquid democracy system would be impossible without the aid of computers to keep track of the decisions made by each person. It’s still far too early to call DemocracyOS’s implementation of liquid democracy a success, but it’s not a stretch to say that DemocracyOS has impacted Buenos Aires in a tangible way, despite all the setbacks it has experienced.</p><p>The vision for DemocracyOS isn’t a partisan appeal, but one they hope to implement at a systemic level. However, because the Net Party is a political party, it is vulnerable to the same political partisanship that any party is subject to. It didn’t take long for Santiago to discover two problems. First, that forcing transparency into a system through political means is going to face pushback from the people benefitting from incumbent systems. And second, that people may use these tools of transparency as a political play to appear more transparent without actually becoming more transparent.</p><p>Today, Santiago no longer works on DemocracyOS. Emboldened instead by a mission that is broader and more ambitious in scope, Santiago tells me about the potential for the blockchain to give power back to the people. Calling his new project <a href="http://democracy.earth/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democracy Earth</a>, Santiago hopes providing smart contracts via a blockchain for transparent decision making can bring back power to individuals.</p><p>The idea of a post-nation state world, as Democracy Earth is preparing for, is hard to picture given the state of international affairs today. And even if such a world will eventually come to pass, it’s hard to predict how we get to that day.</p><h1 id="vtaiwan-and-the-sunflower-movement"><strong><strong>vTaiwan and the Sunflower Movement</strong></strong></h1><p>Beyond being known for it’s culture of endless street food, Taiwan is arguably the most progressive country in Asia. With a population of 23 million people, Taiwan is comparable in population to Australia. But because of historic geopolitical tensions with China, Taiwan’s relationship with the world is contentious and complicated. Outside of Taiwan, little has been understood about the dramatic political changes starting from Japanese rule in 1895 to the ending of martial law in 1987 to the first free election in 1996 to the vibrant democracy it is today.</p><p>Despite being a young, progressive democracy, Taiwan’s internal politics have been rooted in deep controversy. Still formally known as the Republic of China after the nationalists fled mainland China to Taiwan in 1949, the tensions between the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China have never been resolved. Today, only 2.4% of people between the ages of 20-29 in Taiwan identify themselves as Chinese.</p><p>The last time I was in Taiwan was 2005, when my travel experiences were still very much filtered through the itinerary set up by my parents, including visits to the zoo and other family excursions. But as I landed in Taiwan this past December, this time I was on my own: determined to ask hard questions about the sweeping, undeniable changes happening in Asia and around the world.</p><p>As a descendant of Taiwanese ancestry myself, uncovering the historical events along my lineage often left me perplexed, shocked, and in disbelief as I walked through the streets that raised my parents and grandparents. My grandparents have seen multiple cycles of politics in Taiwan, from growing up under Japanese colonialism and learning Japanese as a part of primary education to the Taiwan it is today.</p><p>In 2016, Taiwan elected its first female president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsai_Ing-wen" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tsai Ing Wen</a>, the former chairwoman of the Democratic People’s Party. Taiwan’s DPP, although with it’s own set of shortcomings, has positioned itself in modern years as being the progressive party advocating for LGBT rights, workers, and other typically liberal political ideologies. The DPP has significant anti-China sentiments, leaning on the side of independence from China.</p><p>As the public perception in Taiwan drifts further away from a historic Chinese identity, the Taiwanese identity becomes increasingly distinct from that of the Chinese. It is under these conditions that younger generations are forming their own national identities, growing up only knowing their country as a nation independent from China. I couldn’t help but ponder how easily I could have been Taiwan-raised, but for better or worse life dealt me a US passport instead of a Taiwanese one.</p><p>Economically, Taiwan was once the world’s factory. Everything used to come with “Made in Taiwan” tags and stickers. Known as one of the four tigers of Asia (the other three being Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea), Taiwan’s GDP grew at exceptionally high rates between the 1960s and the 1990s.</p><blockquote>But today, China is developing economically at rates unlike anything the world has ever seen before, causing Taiwan and other neighbors in the Asia-Pacific to cede markets to China because they can no longer compete.</blockquote><p>In a post pax-americana world, China stands to surpass the United States in global leadership, although it’s unlikely to happen in the near future. It is this rapid consolidation of economic and geopolitical power that is worrying the Taiwanese; a political stalemate causing Taiwan to pay extremely close attention to how China treats Hong Kong as a premonition of what Taiwan itself is likely to face.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="CKS memorial hall in Taipei" width="4000" height="2992" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20161231_113624.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It is these circumstances in Taiwan that provides fertile ground for new political experiments. One effort to digitize civic participation in Taiwan is led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrey Tang</a>, the youngest and first transgender official in Taiwan’s executive government. Audrey represents a new generation of political leaders, one that grew up with the internet, recognizes globalization, and is tasked with bringing a technology mindset into old, bureaucratic processes.</p><p>Audrey spends much of her time working on <a href="https://www.vtaiwan.org.tw/" rel="noopener noreferrer">vTaiwan</a>. vTaiwan is a liquid democracy platform that resembles DemocracyOS. Like DemocracyOS, vTaiwan gives everyday citizens the ability to weigh in on many issues that are important to them, allowing them to be more directly involved in their country’s politics. Through vTaiwan, citizens have participated in more transparent government conversations.</p><p>Audrey calls vTaiwan “a working implementation of multi-stakeholder consultation and crowd-sourced agenda setting”. From the outset, the challenge facing such a platform is making it a place for everyone, and avoiding it from skewing out in favor of one demographic or another.</p><p>This type of deliberative democracy was born out of the Sunflower Student Movement of 2014. As a prime example of the kind of organization that young people are willing and active in, demonstrators occupied the legislature for weeks in 2014 as a backlash to a proposed trade deal between Taiwan and China. The scale of such demonstrations was unprecedented, as the legislature has never been occupied by citizens in the history of Taiwan.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/13760423903_73c5a2e7ff_b-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>In the resolution of the Sunflower Movement, the students declared that one of their goals was to bring deliberation of policies into the community, bringing an even more open democracy to citizens.</p><p>As I learned about Taiwan’s history with little prerequisite knowledge, the biases from the different accounts and takes on historical events are obvious in a way that my own biases are not. The media landscape in Taiwan, although existing in a country that promotes free press, struggles with many of the same issues we see around the world. The drop in advertising and print revenue is placing a larger financial burden on publications in the US and around the world. But an additional problem facing Taiwan can be traced to cross-strait relations, creating an environment where pro-China publications are likely to receive funding from China, leaving other publications in Taiwan less staffed and resourced.</p><p><a href="http://thediplomat.com/authors/j-michael-cole/" rel="noopener noreferrer">J Michael Cole</a> moved to Taiwan as a journalist nearly a decade ago, and after reporting for organizations such as the <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taipei Times</a>, he has recently started a new Taiwan-focused media organization called <a href="http://taiwansentinel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taiwan Sentinel</a> founded with the goal of providing in-depth reporting on Taiwan to an international audience.</p><p>In a brief conversation at the launch of Taiwan Sentinel, J Michael spoke about how even the top news organizations in the world have a hard time covering Taiwan. Austin Ramzy, a foreign correspondent for the New York Times, was forced out of China in 2014 and decided to relocate to Taipei to become the first Times journalist to be based out of Taiwan. Upon arriving, Austin met with J Michael only to realize how starkly different Taiwan is from mainland China.</p><p>The number of western journalists covering Taiwan is still next to none, but without a proper array of journalists, it’s hard for Americans and others to recognize the gravity of events happening in Taiwan.</p><p>After Tsai and Trump spoke over the phone following Trump’s election, a media firestorm erupted in response to Trump being the first head of state to speak with a Taiwanese head of state since diplomatic relations were cut off under Nixon. This media firestorm was highly critical in western outlets, but highly optimistic to the Taiwanese. Many Taiwanese saw it as a reconciliation of diplomatic relations between the two countries, but unfortunately, relations between Taiwan and the US are unlikely to improve under Trump.</p><p>These are the kinds of events that, when reported well, have the ability to shape popular opinion with a broader understanding of geopolitical relationships, prompting people to organize in ways such as the Sunflower movement.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>One way to measure the health of a democratic nation is how it protects a citizen’s human rights via rule of law, including protections of speech, assembly, press, voting, etc. However, another way to assess the health of a democracy is to look at how civically engaged it’s citizens are.</p><p>The measure of what is protected by law in a country is often an imperfect picture of whether a country’s people are benefactors and users of a democratic (or not so democratic) system. In fact, it’s possible to argue that the democratic health of a nation has more to do with how active citizens are civically than the agendas and laws written by the leaders: it’s the difference between what the system allows and how people are actually using the system.</p><p>The 2016 US presidential election saw less than 55% of voters turning out to vote, putting voter turnout in the model democracy lower than the majority of other countries. The decay of American democracy wasn’t in the fact that an inexperienced outsider won the electoral college, but that millions of Americans decided that they couldn’t be bothered to vote. Thus, despite the fact that laws in the US protect citizens’ rights to vote (voter ID laws and suppression aside), America’s democracy is threatened by a constant political apathy.</p><p>Whether or not you blame this outcome on a biased media and fake news on social media, news media often serves as the catalyst for political organization and action, manifesting itself as engagements with online platforms, physical protests, lawsuits, or anything else.</p><p>By the standards of participation, the measure of success for platforms like vTaiwan and DemocracyOS may not be so much the legislation or opportunities for civic engagement that they bring, but how it enables citizens to become more politically active. Being digital in nature, internet platforms such as the ones we’ve explored tend to skew toward younger, tech-savvy, educated citizens. The benefits of asynchronous, location-agnostic organizing also struggle to making sure a diverse set of voices are present in the constructive conversations and deliberations.</p><p>However, despite these challenges, digital platforms for civic engagement will continue to evolve, even as nations continue to wrestle with how to best regulate an internet that is not bounded by borders, easily manipulable, and constantly evolving to give their citizens new ways to engage, while also properly curbing cyberattacks.</p><p>Whether it be the blockchain, even more ubiquitous mobile devices, or smarter internet regulations, it’s inevitable that the final frontier for the internet revolution is going to be civic engagement, and it’s going to take far more than a president who uses Twitter to get us there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the fact that humans have been developing technology since the dawn of time, technology is still completely misunderstood.</p><p>When we hear the word technology, our first inclination is to think of our iPhones or computers interacting with the internet. If you’re a little more technically inclined, you may think about writing code or working with certain tools. And maybe if you’re a little bit more cognizant of your lives and culture (or are a parent), you may think about the effects of technology as it applies to areas of child development, social interactions, or otherwise.</p><p>But when viewed from an even larger perspective, we find that technology is so much more than all of that. Kevin Kelly does a phenomenal job at exploring technology and what he coins as the “technium” in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143120174/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143120174&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=diplateevo-20&amp;linkId=HR5CUPMGSMQQ6H2W">What Technology Wants</a>. This blog post is basically a compilation of my thoughts and lessons gleaned from reading the book, I am not taking credit for any of the thinking.</p><p>Essentially, the technium describes a kingdom of species, much like the other six kingdoms of living things. It is the entire network and collection of all the tools that have ever been created and utilized, including culture, art, social institutions, and intellectual creation of all types.</p><p>At first glance, it might seem a little strange to consider technology as a kingdom of life, but when considered as such, it becomes easier to recognize different trends and understand where technology came from and where it is going.</p><h2 id="the-power-of-a-meme">The Power of a Meme</h2><p>The most significant transitions in human history have all centered around a revolution in the ways that we communicate. Communication, the fundamental method in which people share thoughts, is the building block on top of which humans have been able to build and accomplish the things that we have. In the same way that a gene is the building block for biological life, memes are the building blocks for technology.</p><p>The first revolution in communication happened when humans began vocally transmitting ideas to each other. By creating language, people are able to quickly and easy share thoughts from one person to another. Having a common language changed everything, and can be considered the first singularity for humans.</p><blockquote>“Language is a trick that allows the mind to question itself; a magic mirror that reveals to the mind what the mind thinks; a handle that turns a mind into a tool.” – Kevin Kelly</blockquote><p>The next revolution in communication happened when spoken language became written language. All of a sudden, humans developed a way not only to physically transmit thoughts to someone who was in the range of your vocal chords, we developed a way to share thoughts at a distance of both time and space.</p><p>Having a written language was powerful, but still limited by how much a single person could write. With the invention of the printing press, books could now be made for a fraction of the cost, and suddenly one person could speak to a massive number of people.</p><p>Not too long after came the radio, broadcast television, and other media, causing yet another shift in the way that technology enable humans to communicate with each other.</p><p>And finally, the most recent innovation that is completely changing the way that people communicate has been the digitization of content and the network of computers that have permeated the 21st century.</p><p>The implications of going from a non linguistic culture to a linguistic culture to a digital culture are huge. It’s not just that the technological landscape is different, it’s that humans operate in a fundamentally different way. Language is an inseparable aspect of the human experience.</p><h2 id="exponential-growth">Exponential Growth</h2><p>However, there are many attributes of the technium that make it drastically different than any biological kingdom. While biology undergoes a natural linear process of evolution, technology evolves at an exponential rate, causing a vastly different trajectory.</p><p><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s law</a> explains that every 18 months, for the same price point, the power of the technology that you can buy doubles. We see this trend in processing power, disk space, etc. It wasn’t that long ago that 128MB microSD cards were considered large.</p><p>Because technology advances at an exponential rate, the evolution and development increases at a rate that most people have an extremely difficult time wrapping their minds around. Humans are naturally local and linear thinkers, because humans evolved in a world in which the things that mattered to an individual happened right next to them. Additionally, there was minimal change from generation to generation, establishing cultures that by nature, do not adapt well to change.</p><p>I recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/145161683X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=145161683X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=diplateevo-20&amp;linkId=SNIK24X4THLPH7DT">Abundance by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler</a> for more on this.</p><h2 id="exotropy">Exotropy</h2><p>Kelly describes exotropy as negative entropy. In other words, the reversal of disorder. Everything, including technology, follows an exotropic progression, bringing more diversity into the world with each step of evolution. From the first few moments of the existence of the universe where there existed only particles of very basic elements, the universe has self organized into galaxies, planets, and different forms of life.</p><blockquote>“Exotropy is neither wave nor particle, nor pure energy, nor supernatural miracle. It is an immaterial flow that is very much like information. Since exotropy is defined as negative entropy – the reversal of disorder – it is, by definition, an increase in order.” – Kevin Kelly</blockquote><p>As a result of Moore’s law and the nature of technological progress, technology increases the rate of exotropy in the universe. While biological systems can only evolve incrementally with a couple genetic changes every generation, technology is only restricted by mankind’s ability to innovate.</p><p>Technological exotropy can be seen in the enormous diversity of different technological species that exist in the world today. Technology allowed us to accomplish a more diverse set of tasks that nature has not been able to achieve, such as space travel, supersonic flight, seamless ubiquitous communication, etc.</p><p>The phenomena produces a powerful cycle of scaffolding, in which the tools that we build help us build better tools in an endless cycle of exponential improvement. Where as biological systems can only make improvements at a marginal rate, technology enables at a much more exponential pace.</p><h2 id="coevolution">Coevolution</h2><p>On one side of global progress is the development of technology, but there is a whole other side, the development of humans, that is not as frequently talked about nor thought about. The very tools that humans spend their lives developing and building, the tools also deeply change the way that we do life. It’s impossible to imagine life without language, because language is a technology that has reached ubiquity in the human race, being integrated deep into everything that we do.</p><p>As humans simultaneously develop with technology, there is a whole body of literature that argues the convergence of humanity and technology known as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143037889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=diplateevo-20&amp;linkId=M5IJ6Q7AQRONPI2D">the singularity</a>. Popularized by inventor Ray Kurzweil, the singularity refers to a point in time in which man and machine are indistinguishable from each other. According to Kurzweil, the singularity will take place by 2045.</p><p>Regardless of whether you believe the singularity will happen in the next 30 years, getting to the singularity implies a great deal of change that depends on how quickly humans are able to adapt. The problem isn’t that technologies aren’t being invented fast enough, the problem is that humans aren’t learning how to use technologies fast enough.</p><p>One of the clearest examples of coevolution is the development of cities, Kelly calls cities “technological artifacts, the largest technology we make”. With cities, humans literally build and evolve the world around them. We create modes of transportation, urban environments, and all sorts of experiences ranging from museums to academic institutions to restaurants and more. As our space around us changes, so does the way that we live our lives. In fact, most city dwellers would not survive a couple days in the wilderness.</p><h2 id="multiple-evolution">Multiple Evolution</h2><p>Multiple evolution is a concept that is rarely articulated, but a phenomena that deeply affects the progress and discoveries of life. Multiple evolution is the idea that multiple innovations evolve in a simultaneously independent manner. This happens in every field from art, literature, research, technology, biology and more.</p><p>For example, the infamous story of Harry Potter was not the only book written about boy wizards in magical schools with pet owls who enter other worlds through railway station platforms. In fact, there are arguably a few authors who have written books of the same nature at the same time without any knowledge of each other’s existence.</p><p>It becomes interesting when you realize that not only works of literature, but many scientific and technological discoveries and innovations, although not implemented in an identical manner, were developed simultaneously. Calculus was developed by Newton and Liebniz, Darwin was not the sole fabricator of evolution, etc etc.</p><p>This supports the idea that technological evolution inevitably progresses in a certain direction, because if one innovator didn’t invent a particular technology, chances are someone else would have. This also supports the concept that technology has it’s own evolutionary tendencies independent of the input of any single human being.</p><p>One explanation for this phenomenon is that the development of technologies follow a sequence in which all innovation depends on a previous innovation, and it comes down to nothing but a matter of time. You can’t do calculus unless you know how to count. In the same way, television and radio would never have been developed without the printing press, and the development of computers means that a network of computers would inevitably happen.</p><h2 id="social-and-political-implications">Social and Political Implications</h2><p>Of course, it would be irresponsible to talk about the evolution of technology without talking about the social and political implications that technology creates. The elephant in the room is that the affluent individuals with access to technology create an extremely large opportunity gap between them and people who may not have enough resources to be on the cutting edge.</p><p>As a result of technology, the disparity between modern societies and traditional societies are enormous. The disparity caused by such an inequality between people with access to technology and people without has implications in economics, health, and the overall standard of living.</p><p>However, because of the exponential nature of technology, individuals who are behind on the technological curve do not remain in the dark forever. Like the inevitability of developments, it is only a matter of time before a technology reaches ubiquity among the entire human population.</p><p>In the case of the internet, conservative estimates are that the majority of the world will be on the internet in the next few years. This is significant, because the internet will soon become flooded with billions of people coming online in the next few years.</p><p>Thus, the question when it comes to social and political implications is not what to do with the disparity, but how to increase the speed that a technology reaches ubiquity.</p><h2 id="new-platforms-for-art-and-expression">New Platforms for Art and Expression</h2><p>One observation that I’ve made is that as technology advances, it creates more mediums for human expression, which can also be considered a form of technology. In many ways, function and form, especially when it comes to our technology, are becoming increasingly inseparable.</p><p>New technologies are constantly disrupting old ones and changing the way that we express ourselves. By lowering the barrier of entry to traditionally hard to enter industries, technology allows anyone to share thoughts, connect with people, create media, etc etc.</p><p><a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> famously calls this the era of the “connection economy”, in which value no longer resides in having knowledge, but in being able to synthesize and connect different things in order to creatively innovate new products, services, and ideas.</p><h2 id="applying-new-technologies">Applying New Technologies</h2><p>As new technology is applied, a couple things happen. Firstly, most technology is never applied exactly how the inventor imagined it, oftentimes being applied in completely different ways to achieve completely different results. Thus, it is impossible for an inventor of a technology to fully understand the implications of his creation let alone what it will be used for.</p><p>For instance, when television first came out, television programs were nothing more than recorded broadway shows being aired, leaving the full potential of television completely untapped. The inventor of the television did not foresee the application of such a technology to all the different uses that it is being used for today.</p><p>Secondly, the implications of any piece of technology upon culture is extremely hard to foresee. For example, the inventor of the car probably would not have imagined the whole infrastructure of roads, streetlights, gas stations, car dealers, traffic jams, insurance, etc that exist today.</p><p>This leads to a very interesting situation, in which it is difficult to predict exactly how revolutionary a certain new technology will be until we are literally on the verge of implementing the technology in a way that changes everything. And any technology that can be used to completely revolutionize the world can also be abused, meaning that it is inherently impossible to have full control over the technium.</p><h2 id="a-value-system-applied-to-technology">A Value System Applied to Technology</h2><p>Even though technology has an inevitable progression, it is very possible to apply a value system to steer technology in a way that is favorable to improving the human condition. The amish, a group of people who live with very little technology, exemplify how it is possible to live in a modern day world while having a very specific value system guiding their technology use.</p><p>With the understanding that any technology that is revolutionary can also have immense consequences, the amish are very cautious to introduce a new technology that might detract from their emphasis on community. However, despite the fact that they do not adapt most technologies, the amish are quite knowledgable about the technology that is going on in the world.</p><p>There’s a whole system in place in order to maintain the integrity of their social and religious values, in which community members are allowed to petition to test new technologies in their personal lives while being observed by the rest of the community to see how the particular technology impacts the community as a whole.</p><p>The amish do not live outside of technology, the live inside the technium in such a way where they slow it down, not stopping it entirely. Through this experience of elective poverty and minimalism, they are able to maximize their ultimate goals of valuing community.</p><blockquote>“To maximize our own contentment, we seek the minimum amount of technology in our lives. Yet to maximize the contentment of others, we must maximize the amount of technology in the world.” – Kevin Kelly</blockquote><p>Thus, just because a technology has the potential to be harmful, that doesn’t mean that we should avoid it altogether. Every technology has benefits as well as drawbacks, but as long there is slightly more upside than downside, we shouldn’t completely ignore new innovations.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143120174/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143120174&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=diplateevo-20&amp;linkId=HR5CUPMGSMQQ6H2W">What Technology Wants</a> has been one of the books that have introduced many new concepts in a way that got me thinking a lot about the world that we live in. It is truly a book with very convincing insights about technology and more importantly the human experience and human condition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In college, I frequently thought about dropping out of school to pursue startup ambitions, but in retrospect, getting my degree was the better choice.</p><p>Four years ago, I sat down with my parents and handed them a proposal for taking a gap year. I spent weeks excruciating over this letter, finally articulating all of my thoughts into words:</p><blockquote>“…Many of my peers attend and eagerly await nothing but the end. Learning becomes a burden and a chore, and done solely for the sake of obtaining a diploma. I want to be able to clearly see the difference between learning for the sake of actually knowing vs learning for the sake of finishing school. Seeing a world outside of what I currently know and am used to will give me a perspective / reality check whenever I feel unmotivated to learn…”</blockquote><p>Long story short, I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life, and wanted time before college to figure that out.</p><p>At least that’s what I told my parents. My real struggle wasn’t entirely about figuring out what I wanted to do with my life, but also about figuring out why higher education would be valuable to me. At the time, I saw college as an expensive waste of time filled with empty promises of material success that I would leave me unfulfilled.</p><p>All my high school friends seemed to be talking about the schools they wanted to attend while I spent my days considering why college would be valuable for me. I heard many reasons over and over for the next few months, but none of them satisfied me. I was dissatisfied with the system, jaded by all the contrived homework questions and classes.</p><p>I couldn’t see how doing homework and taking tests would help me in the real world of business and engineering. I couldn’t see how going through a four year program would be more time and cost effective in learning the skills I needed in my career.</p><p>When I consulted with my parents and other mentor figures in my life at the time, I felt like I was speaking on a different wavelength. It seemed that I was being carried by a stream of blind faith that “engineering was the only way to make a living” and that I had to go to college to get into those jobs. But as I boiled down their points into things that I could consider, I heard a few very common reasons that I should get a college degree.</p><h3 id="-you-need-a-college-engineering-degree-to-get-a-job-">“You need a college engineering degree to get a job.”</h3><p>As kindergarteners, our teachers welcomed us to class by asking us what we wanted to be when we grew up, encouraging us to follow our aspirations of becoming firefighters, authors, teachers, etc. But the older we got, the responses to these “childish” ambitions turned into not-so-subtle demands to take advanced math classes in order to pursue more lucrative professions.</p><p>We were inundated with talk from parents and peers about the schools and jobs that “people they know” got in a seemingly endless comparison of one’s worth to their education and career pedigrees. And yet, despite all the talk about getting in to good schools, the emphasis seemed to be placed on one of three fields: engineering, medicine, or law.</p><p>Dissatisfied with those arguments, I found myself inspired by stories of people who went against conventional wisdom to make significant contributions in their fields without having a college degree: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. I spent sleepless nights listening to speeches, reading books, and watching documentaries about these larger-than-life figures, hoping to extract the things that made them great and apply them to my life.</p><p>With so many examples of successful people who had dropped out of college as well as college graduates that struggled to secure employment, I concluded that the prerequisites for success surely must be independent from whether someone actually followed through with college or not. If education was nothing more than a series of hoops that people had to jump through to obtain a piece of paper, there had to be more effective ways of building up credibility in a field. I could probably teach myself practical aspects of computer science instead of getting stuck in the theory taught by academia.</p><h3 id="-college-is-a-place-to-meet-people-and-build-a-network-">“College is a place to meet people and build a network.”</h3><p>One of the most common things that people would tell me was about the people they had the opportunity to meet in college, forming the strongest groups of friends that they still interact with in their adult lives. They argued that the college years was the best time to make friends, build a professional network, and date.</p><p>This point made little sense to me, as college life was as appealing as getting tangled into a web horrible frat parties, boring lecture halls, and awful dorm experiences while paying obscene amounts to do so. How was I going to find a network among other students? I wanted to meet and learn from top figures in industry, not students that would ask to copy my homework.</p><p>I couldn’t see how attending college would help me build a network of connections that would help me start my career, because everyone that I wanted to network with weren’t anywhere close to academia. I looked up to programs like the <a href="http://thielfellowship.org/">Thiel Fellowship</a> and <a href="http://uncollege.org/">Uncollege</a> because they gave their fellows access to networks of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.</p><h3 id="-college-gives-you-time-to-experiment-before-being-in-the-real-world-">“College gives you time to experiment before being in the real world.”</h3><p>To many, college is also the time for people to try things and learn from mistakes. If the goal is to move fast and break things, I was told that college would be a place where I could make mistakes in a safer sandbox.</p><p>But if college is supposed to be a sandbox for me to learn and experiment before going out into the world, why is it structured as a series of classes and lectures? To me, things like grades, curves, and application processes made college feel more like a competition rather than the experimental laboratory that people were telling me it would be. Additionally, it seemed more appealing to experiment outside of the walls of academia, where the money that would be going toward tuition would go much further than what I might get out of academia.</p><p>I felt that a self-education system based on traveling, reading, and one-on-one meetings would be much more personalized and impactful personally. I could read books on my own, meet with experts, and travel for less than the cost of a year’s worth of tuition. And with so much content available online, I could access any information whenever I wanted to.</p><h1 id="so-what-is-college-for">So What is College For?</h1><p>But despite all these reservations about the value of higher education, I went.</p><p>One night toward the beginning of my freshman year, I was sitting on the Warren lawn talking to a few new friends I had just made. I had been hesitant to share my reservations about higher education with anyone up to that point, but that night I made my thoughts known.</p><p>“I don’t know if I’ll stay in college. I mean, I don’t see the point.”</p><p>In retrospect, telling people that you might leave college is not the best way to make friends as a freshman, but somehow these people stuck with me and became my best college friends. As college life quickly enveloped every aspect life, I struggled with an inner voice doubting if I was doing the right thing with my life.</p><p>I went through most of my first year trying to figure out how to make the most of my college education, given the fact that I didn’t feel like my education had a purpose. I attended events whenever I could, always looking for an excuse to spend time away from my campus. I didn’t really care about my grades, and slipped into academic probation toward the middle of my sophomore year.</p><p>I remember opening that email and seeing a hideous 1.866 GPA. At that moment, I was met with a real decision: Either I would put more effort into my academics or I would leave entirely and work full-time on my self-education that I had been doing concurrently with college.</p><p>Then, a few weeks later, I found myself on a trip to Silicon Valley with <a href="http://brighteyes-students.org/">BrightEyes</a>, a program designed to give UCSD students a tour of startups and venture capital in Silicon Valley. I was talking to <a href="http://tiffanydstone.com/">Tiffany</a>, the director of the BrightEyes program, asking for advice on how I should reconcile my startup ambitions with my education.</p><p>“You need to finish school.” She told me.</p><p>Coming back after BrightEyes, I reluctantly decided I would invest more into my academics. I pulled myself out of academic probation, but the question remained: what is the point of college?</p><p>At some point in my junior year, I came across an <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2015/09/the-neoliberal-arts/">article by William Deresiewicz</a> that challenged my fundamental assumptions about college.</p><blockquote>“This is education in the age of neoliberalism. Call it Reaganism or Thatcherism, economism or market fundamentalism, neoliberalism is an ideology that reduces all values to money values. The worth of a thing is the price of the thing. The worth of a person is the wealth of the person. Neoliberalism tells you that you are valuable exclusively in terms of your activity in the marketplace — in Wordsworth’s phrase, your getting and spending.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>It is not the humanities per se that are under attack. It is learning: learning for its own sake, curiosity for its own sake, ideas for their own sake. It is the liberal arts, but understood in their true meaning, as all of those fields in which knowledge is pursued as an end in itself, the sciences and social sciences included. History, sociology, and political-science majors endure the same kind of ritual hazing (“Oh, so you decided to go for the big bucks”) as do people who major in French or philosophy. Governor Rick Scott of Florida has singled out anthropology majors as something that his state does not need more of. Everybody talks about the STEM fields — science, technology, engineering, and math — but no one’s really interested in science, and no one’s really interested in math: interested in funding them, interested in having their kids or their constituents pursue careers in them. That leaves technology and engineering, which means (since the second is a subset of the first) it leaves technology.”</blockquote><p>Little did I know, but this one essay would lead me to realize that the purpose of a university education is so much greater than the career that would be enabled as a result. Yes, college degrees often serve as a funnel into specific careers, but seeing college as merely a means to a job is selling it short of what it really is.</p><p>Learning for the sake of applying it to a career to make money is hollow at best. Learning is so much more than that; it’s about exploring the creative aspects of humanity, thinking deeply about existence, relationships, and phenomena in our universe. It’s about learning for learning’s sake, allowing curiosity to lead you where money won’t, and becoming a more informed citizen.</p><p>At a certain level, universities represent the best of this curiosity. Whether it be forays into areas of arts, humanities, and literature or scientific endeavors to sequence the human genome, curiosity enables universities to create the world of tomorrow. Universities are home to some of the most groundbreaking and innovative research that currently exists. The fundamental incentives and structure of university research leads to technology breakthroughs that would not be discovered in industry. Just consider physics research as CERN, Oceanography research at UCSD, etc.</p><p>The value of a college degree isn’t about the student experience, future careers, or social circles. College is valuable for the exploration and discovery of yourself, the world, and how the two interact. It’s about being alongside faculty and professors that are pioneers in their respective fields, whether it be biological research, quantum physics, or another field.</p><p>The fact that public universities are exempt from the pressures to build and sell products in the same way that corporations are allows public universities to approach subjects from a different angle, giving students and faculty the freedom to explore natural phenomenon, history, etc without worrying about finding profitable applications for their research.</p><p>This allows academia to explore things at a much deeper, more holistic level, often allowing them to do research that is far ahead of industry, and working out the fundamental theory of why things work. There’s a general trend of people criticizing universities for being too theoretical and not adequately preparing students for the real world, but the truth is that we need universities to continue focusing on theory. Specifics become obsolete much faster than theory does.</p><p>As a society ingrained in the profit motive, it’s no surprise that colleges market themselves as a place for students to learn how to be successful in industry. But as I had to figure out on my own, that’s not the point of an education. We need to start having real expectations of what college is and what it isn’t. College isn’t optimized for being successful in the workplace, it’s optimized for creating an environment that lets people explore deeply on the issues we face today.</p><p>College isn’t for everyone, especially given the calculus of going to college for an economic incentive. But regardless, college is an opportunity that everyone should have, regardless of race, class, status, or gender. And for those interested in jumping straight into a career, we should be giving apprenticeship and bootcamp programs much more consideration in the talent pipeline.</p><p>Once I decided that my college education wasn’t about establishing a future career for myself, it freed me to dive deeper into the things I wanted to learn just for the sake of learning. I found myself enjoying classes and assignments for this first time, appreciative of being able to learn from and talk to the faculty that was teaching me.</p><p>So to everyone who helped me through my college years, I have two things to say. First, sorry if I was difficult through the years in my frustrations. And second, thank you for your support, I would not be where I am today if I hadn’t gone through college.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around this time last year, I was chatting with one of my friends about the recent trend of college hackathons and he blurted, “wouldn’t it be awesome to have a hackathon at the white house?” We talked about it a bit before getting back to our homework.</p><p><em>This is the transcript of the TEDx talk I gave at UCSD.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/If69xHnuCyY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I am a computer scientist by training, but as someone who has been in school for the majority of my life, I’ve spent a good amount of time reflecting on my own education. For a long time education and technology have been separate disciplines, but as technology is increasingly incorporated into every area of our lives, education also increasingly incorporates technology.</p><h2 id="how-we-got-here">How We Got Here</h2><p>In the spirit of getting teaching and learning into the digital era, we’ve tried many different ideas to make education more digital. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?_r=0">2012 was the year of the Massive Open Online Courses</a> (also known as MOOCs), and promises to make learning, faster, cheaper, and better scaled to students everywhere. The result? Teachers recording lectures the same way they would give them in a classroom, putting them online, resulting in completion rates of about 15%.</p><p>In 2013, LA unified school district <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ipad-curriculum-refund-20150415-story.html">planned to spend $1.3 billion on iPads</a>, only to turn around on cold feet after realizing that the software and infrastructure wasn’t what they thought they signed up for.</p><p>Despite these failures, there are also many instances of technology having a significant positive impact on education. Students all over the country are using technology in their education, in everything from research to video projects to computer science.</p><p>Albemarle County Schools in Charlottesville Virginia is one example among many pockets of primary and secondary schools that <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-02-albemarle-county-schools-journey-from-a-makerspace-to-a-maker-district">have received national acclaim for the success of their makerspaces</a>, inspiring many of their K12 students to use creative technological mediums to share what they’ve learned.</p><p>And through the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/connected">ConnectEd initiative of the Obama administration</a>, more schools in the US are providing internet access to their students than ever before, helping students to prepare themselves to work with the digital tools that are ubiquitous today.</p><p>But as the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/asian-nations-dominate-international-test-100159386.html?ref=gs">test scores of our nation has fallen far behind</a> those of China, Singapore, Japan, Korea, and Finland, people are justified in pointing out that our efforts with education technology have not given us the results that our technology had promised.</p><p>Technology was supposed to improve education by making it higher quality, more accessible, and more affordable. But while technology has improved education for some, it hasn’t been as successful as we’ve been hoping for as a nation.</p><p><strong><strong>What happened? Wasn’t technology supposed to come in as the grand superhero and solve all of our problems as it did for so many other sectors? As a Silicon Valley native, I wondered: what would it take for technology to disrupt education?</strong></strong></p><h2 id="down-the-rabbit-hole">Down the Rabbit Hole</h2><p>Pondering this point for myself, I went on a journey to learn as much as I could about our education system, venturing far outside the perimeter of the technology sector.</p><p>Remember that conversation about hackathons we had? In September of 2015, my friend became an intern at the White House and I started interning at the US Department of Education. I couldn’t believe it.</p><p>But that was only the beginning. How would two interns convince senior staff to let us host such an event? Interns don’t just come in and tell people what to do. And the prospect of hosting a “hackathon”, a type of event rather foreign to public officials, would prove to be a very difficult task. The White House doesn’t even have Wi-Fi.</p><p>After brainstorming some ideas only to have them sit on the desks of white house staff, we had a better idea: what if we did it as a part of CS Education Week?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/GOPR0025.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="DCIM100GOPRO" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/GOPR0025.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/GOPR0025.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/GOPR0025.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/GOPR0025.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>On December 7th, 2015, we welcomed teachers, developers, and students to the white house for a CS Tech Jam as a part of Computer Science Education week. Participants had a simple goal: to start something that would improve CS Education in America’s public elementary schools, addressing early STEM biases that keep girls and minorities out of computer science.</p><p>We brought in teams from Sphero, Glasslab Games, Magic Leap, Google, and more along with local high school and college students and teachers from all over to US.</p><p>Projects at the tech jam included a simple game to programmatically play chutes and ladders, a game to learn about logic gates, and an instagram-like app that allowed users to upload code that rendered into artistic animations.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/GOPR0031_1449503045616_high.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="DCIM100GOPRO" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/GOPR0031_1449503045616_high.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/GOPR0031_1449503045616_high.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/GOPR0031_1449503045616_high.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/GOPR0031_1449503045616_high.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>This is a picture of the team from Magic Leap brainstorming with a few teachers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/GOPR0040_1449504860953_high.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="DCIM100GOPRO" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/GOPR0040_1449504860953_high.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/GOPR0040_1449504860953_high.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/GOPR0040_1449504860953_high.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/GOPR0040_1449504860953_high.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>This is the team building the game for students to manipulate logic gates.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/CSEdWeek2-TechJam--1-.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="CSEdWeek2-TechJam" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/CSEdWeek2-TechJam--1-.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/CSEdWeek2-TechJam--1-.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/CSEdWeek2-TechJam--1-.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/CSEdWeek2-TechJam--1-.jpg 2240w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>By bringing together tech companies, teachers, and students, all voices were critical in creating something that would truly be effective. It was in that moment that I had a key realization about education.</p><p>John King, the current secretary of education, in a closing address at the tech jam that we hosted, spoke about the importance of bringing all stakeholders into the conversation.</p><blockquote>“I was encouraged by the level of listening that was taking place. As I visit schools around the country, too often you see technology tools that might have made a difference in theory, but aren’t actually working for kids in the classroom.” – John King</blockquote><p>That day showed me that it was the dialogue between students, educators, and developers that become powerful ideas for education. When we come to the table willing to listen and understand, we are able to personally invest ourselves in a mission that isn’t just about us, but about fundamentally adding value to the people we are serving.</p><p>But what does this have to do with technology?</p><h2 id="the-conversations-in-edtech">The Conversations in Edtech</h2><p>The legend of Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs himself tried many things to improve education with technology.</p><blockquote>“I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.” – Steve Jobs</blockquote><p>The three months I spent at the department of education gave me a bigger picture of the incredibly diverse set of issues that our education system in the United States faces that is unique to our own country. Not only do we have students of every single racial and cultural identity, we have to address different languages, social norms, and expectations.</p><p>Steve Jobs was correct given his assumption of education, but his assumption was fundamentally flawed: He approached education technology as a charitable donation that he hoped would automatically improve teaching and learning. But simply giving a student a computer doesn’t mean that their grammar is going to automatically improve.</p><p><strong><strong>Contrary to the ethos of Silicon Valley, education can’t be disrupted with a single solution.</strong></strong> With so many different stakeholders in such complicated dynamics, getting technology implemented in education isn’t about companies developing and pushing their ideas, but about the conversations with everyone involved: students, teachers, administrators, developers, and more.</p><p>It’s about understanding the problems and utilizing technology only when it is the best tool for the problem. With so many diverse problems in our education system, improving education with technology starts with understanding the types of problems students face on a regular basis. Too often we forget to consider how our decisions impact students of lower socioeconomic statuses, minorities, and other marginalized students.</p><p>In contrast to Steve Job’s statement of using technology in teaching and learning, former secretary of education Arne Duncan framed it in the context of technological access.</p><blockquote>“I worry that technology is not being implemented fast enough. Technology has the ability to improve equity in our public schools, or the ability to exacerbate current equity gaps.” – Arne Duncan</blockquote><p>Trying to unify the two perspectives led me to my next question: Given that we can’t make assumptions about the solutions that students need, what are the problems that all students, especially disenfranchised students, struggle with on a regular basis?</p><h2 id="listening-to-students">Listening to Students</h2><p>To answer this question, I turned to the tools I know best: web programming. I started thinking about technology in a different way; not just technology as a potential to augment teaching and learning, but as a means of civic engagement and empowerment.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132.png" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot 2016-07-30 15.36.13(2)" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>With a student run nonprofit named Student Voice, I got together with a group of friends and put together <a href="http://www.sturights.org/">the Student Bill of Rights</a>, a collection of 12 rights covering everything from free expression to health and well being to technology.</p><p>Then, in order to allow students to share what matters most to them, I built a voting platform around the 12 rights and allowed students to vote on the three rights most important to them.</p><p>Here is what we found: Of over 1000 students who voted, the most voted on right was free expression, followed by fair assessment, and personal learning. What all three of these have in common is the emphasis on the students. Students want to express themselves, to be understood, and to make education their own.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.222.png" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot 2016-07-30 15.36.22(2)" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.222.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.222.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.222.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.222.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And yet, in an effort to make high school graduates more “college and career ready”, students are increasingly taught to fulfill educational standards in compliance with No Child Left Behind and Common Core, which inherently detracts from a student’s ability to personalize their learning.</p><p>And even some of the technological pushes in education have been nothing more than putting lectures online, worksheets in a digital format, and multiple choice exams on a screen. It is this lack of personal agency that is reflected in the voting results.</p><p><strong><strong>Perhaps the first responsibility of our education systems is to listen to our students.</strong></strong></p><p>To make the quantitative qualitative, we paired the digital voting with a national tour, visiting schools all over the country. On our national tour, Andrew Brennen, the National Field Director for Student Voice, took the step to listen to students and their stories. Here are a few of them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/12779052_980745521975099_8902773440712492291_o.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="12779052_980745521975099_8902773440712492291_o" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/12779052_980745521975099_8902773440712492291_o.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/12779052_980745521975099_8902773440712492291_o.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/12779052_980745521975099_8902773440712492291_o.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/12779052_980745521975099_8902773440712492291_o.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote>“Our field trip account is zero. Our activities account is zero. We keep getting told that all of our money is in the general fund and can’t be used for things like textbooks or paper. This general fund seems great though, some mysterious crazy place. How can I get some of this general fund?”</blockquote><p>This next story, from a refugee student belonging to a group where students openly share stories, showed me the importance of allowing students to freely express themselves before they can be comfortable in their classrooms.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o (1)" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote>“…After my dad died I was so depressed.

After that my mom said we were going to the US and I was like, “What? You never told me that! You never told me anything!” And I start crying more and more and more. I hated my mom for those fifteen days because she never really told me what was going to happen but at the same time I feel happy because if she would’ve told me, I would never have come with her. I got here legally. One of the happiest things when I got here was that I got to meet my uncles and my grandpa. Those people were never in my life before but now they really help me out.”</blockquote><p>These are only a few of the many incredibly personal stories that we’ve collected and shared through our online platforms. And hopefully by getting a small glimpse of what students go through on a regular basis, you’ve come to a similar conclusion that I did: Maybe we’ve been looking at education technology wrong this whole time.</p><p>Technology shouldn’t be a sterile, programmatic medium for students to standardize their learning. It needs to be a tool that allows them to further express their creativity and emotions in a safe way. I don’t see the journey of education as a deterministic computation, I see it as a beautiful mess of emotions, struggles, and community.</p><p>Students are people full of ideas, emotions, problems, character, nuance, culture, ambitions, and thoughts. Students spill out in ways that don’t fit within conventional boundaries. Just look at student organized movements like the Vietnam war protests, demonstrations against genocides overseas, civil rights and black lives matter – students have always been at the forefront of taking action to be the change they want to see in the world.</p><p>I’m not saying that protests are the only way to improve education, but we do need to be heard. Education is not the responsibility of the government, nor is it the responsibility of the teacher. It is the responsibility of the whole community: students, teachers, parents, and educators to dialogue about the things we can do to improve our schools, our country, and the world.</p><p>The ways that students have organized looks vastly different from generation to generation, and as our generation sets the example for what it means to bring equity and equality in our technological age, I hope that you are as proud as I am to be a student attending school in America today.</p><p>As students, we are all inadvertently part of a dialogue that transcends our education systems, whether we are aware of it or not. It is through this dialogue that we have the choice to empower or silence the voices of the students around us. It may be hard to believe that your voice matters in the big picture of education, and that’s how I felt before organizing the White House Tech Jam.</p><p>Education has a long way to go before we solve the problems of quality, equity, affordability, and accessibility. And whether we achieve those solutions through technology or otherwise, it begins with students like us participating in this dialogue. How will you participate in this dialogue?</p><p>I’m going to leave you with a confession:</p><p>I started this journey thinking it would be about technology, but it’s not about the technology; it’s about the student.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although it was very different from internships I was used to, one common point was spending most of my days thinking about how technology is used.</p><p>I had <a href="http://diplateevo.com/lessons-from-my-12-week-internship-at-ooyala/">hardly finished my last internship at Ooyala</a> before I found myself on a plane to Washington DC. Still fresh on the habitual stand ups that comprised the agile development cycle, starting work immediately after my internship in Santa Clara was a culture shock. Thanks to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/eriklaes">Erik</a>, I would have the chance to work in the Department of Education <a href="http://tech.ed.gov/">Office of Educational Technology</a> under the leadership of <a href="http://tech.ed.gov/richard-culatta/">Richard Culatta</a>.</p><p>Washington DC is not for the faint of heart. Standing on the left side of an escalator is a behavior that will result in many anxious people trying to squeeze by you. It makes you wonder what the person next to you on the metro does on a daily basis, even though they are too absorbed in their own worlds to exchange any words.</p><p>Over the summer, as a part of my birthday celebrations in New York, I found my way down to DC to scope out what things would be like. So in this aspect, I was not a newcomer to DC.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/lyndon-baines-johnson-department-of-education-building-photo-thanks-to.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="lyndon-baines-johnson-department-of-education-building-photo-thanks-to" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/lyndon-baines-johnson-department-of-education-building-photo-thanks-to.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/lyndon-baines-johnson-department-of-education-building-photo-thanks-to.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But as I approached the department of education on my first day, I noticed details that I hadn’t on my first visit a month earlier. The Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education sits in a plaza that is spacious in the front with trees planted in little squares left intentionally unpaved. The building itself looks modern and unimpressive when compared to the architecture of the US Capitol or the Library of Congress. It is long, uniform, and has large vertical windows spanning the face of the building.</p><p>Once inside the building, it is drab, sterile, and feels like not much has changed since the building was originally erected – until you walk into the Office of Educational Technology. The Office of Educational Technology (OET for short), led by Richard Culatta and Joseph South, has a modern feel to it. In many ways, it would be hard for someone to tell the difference between the OET office and an average tech company.</p><p>But that’s about where similarities between Silicon Valley and Washington DC end.</p><h2 id="entering-a-new-bubble">Entering a New Bubble</h2><p>Every major city that provides a unique contribution to the world is a bubble to some degree. Whether this be San Francisco, New York, Washington DC, or anywhere else, living anywhere in the world means that you exist inside of some sort of bubble. Therefore, the best way to see outside a bubble is to experience as many of them as you possibly can.</p><p>At one point in my time in DC, while attempting eating at a Chinese restaurant to satisfy the nostalgia of my home cuisine, I overheard a conversation about the presidential race. Just like the conversations you overhear in the valley about tech startups, DC has residents that are unable to avoid talking about politics everywhere that they go.</p><p>But initially, all of the speculations that warranted so much buzz and conversation in DC felt exactly the same as the way people talked about their favorite sports team: energetic but unproductive. Over time, I would start to find myself engaged in more of these conversations.</p><p>I’ve come to realize that many of these commonplace conversations to governmental systems in DC fulfill a role that the private sector does not, sometimes with side effects that I will discuss later in this piece. As much as bubbles can be a real blind spot, they often also center around a valuable lesson for other places to learn from.</p><h2 id="finding-my-feet">Finding My Feet</h2><p>Much like my first week at Ooyala, I found my first week working in Washington DC a very challenging one. It just so happened that I joined on a week where both the director of my office and the deputy were both out for the whole week, leaving me trying my best to keep myself occupied for the first week on my own by learning about all the different things that the office was working on.</p><p>One of the biggest surprises of the first week was the management structure of the department. Although the building that I work in has seven floors housing a huge number of employees, I would spend almost no time interacting with anyone outside of my office. Because the department is very intentionally split into offices, most offices have their own unique projects that they are working on. Even the office spaces are set up in a way that makes it easy to not interact with anyone outside of your own team.</p><p>And because government revolves around doing things for citizens and policies that deal with human behavior, the level of soft skills required to do well in government is higher than that of engineering. In other words, I had to learn how to manage professional relationships in a way that was different from how I previously did, even as a startup founder. Within all the projects that my office was working on, all of them depended on the relationships and buy-in of the districts, companies, and other organizations that we had relationships with.</p><p>Pretty quickly, I found out about the projects that I would spend most of my time at OET focusing on. Specifically, I would get to work on open education and the Learning Registry, a web version of the NETP, and a White House computer science tech jam for CS Education Week.</p><h3 id="open-education">Open Education</h3><p>Today, over $8 billion is spent on paper textbooks annually in the United States. This is a large amount of money that is wasted every year to keep textbooks up to date. But with today’s mobile devices and internet connectivity, it is time we challenge the notion of paying an annual price to keep textbooks up to date.</p><p>The initiative run by OET known as GoOpen is seeking to address this exact issue by creating a repository for openly licensed educational resources. Openly licensed means that not only can teachers use resources created by other people for free, but they have the ability to modify resources to their specific use cases and redistribute however they want.</p><p>The Learning Registry, a repository of open educational resources developed by OET seeks to be a place for all of these resources to reside. By providing an API that allows third party tools to easily read and write to the learning registry, anyone will be able to easily integrate with the Learning Registry.</p><p>The concept of the Learning Registry seemed simple enough, but as i quickly began to realize, the devil is in the details. For instance, in order for resources from multiple publishers to be easily used between each other, they must use a similar metadata structure in order for the resources to be useful. In the early days of the Learning Registry, there were many metadata schemas that were used to define a Learning Resource. However, realizing the trouble of using many different kinds of metadata, LRMI has become the widely accepted format for the Learning Registry.</p><p>I won’t bore you with the details of the Learning Registry, but feel free to <a href="http://learningregistry.org/">check out the website to learn more</a>.</p><p>Additionally, as a part of the push for more openly-licensed materials to benefit schools, OET released a proposed rule for funds granted by the Department of Education to create content. Specifically, if the rule were implemented, grant recipients would be required to openly license anything funded by the Department of Education. <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=ED-2015-OS-0105-0001">Check out the NPRM here</a>.</p><h3 id="national-education-technology-plan">National Education Technology Plan</h3><p>Every five years, the Department of Education releases a <a href="http://tech.ed.gov/netp/">National Education Technology Plan</a>. The plan is “the flagship educational technology policy document for the United States.” To me, the NETP represents the future of what technology can do for students, teachers, administrators, and education as a whole. The 2016 NETP focuses on aspects of equity, leadership, teaching, infrastructure and more to set the vision for how technology can catalyze transformational learning experiences.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/DigitalDivide_Infographic.png" class="kg-image" alt="DigitalDivide_Infographic" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/DigitalDivide_Infographic.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/DigitalDivide_Infographic.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/DigitalDivide_Infographic.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/DigitalDivide_Infographic.png 2242w"></figure><p>Personally, I got to be involved in the creation and distribution of the NETP, learning a lot about the processes that the government has to go through in order to conduct research and release such a document to the public. My role in the NETP was coming up with a way to display the content online. This is the first NETP to have a web version, and will hopefully be built upon in future versions as technology continues to advance.</p><h3 id="white-house-computer-science-tech-jam">White House Computer Science Tech Jam</h3><p>The White House Computer Science Tech Jam, an event that I had the opportunity of organizing, brought together P-6 educators, developers, and students for 10 hours, to generate ideas for how to create new tools, apps, and games for computer science education. It highlighted the need for greater collaboration between educators and developers to improve computer science education, with particular a focus on P-6 education to address early STEM biases and inequities that deter girls and minorities from pursuing STEM studies.</p><p>Although we were inspired by the model of a college hackathon, what resulted was unlike any hackathon I had ever been to. With the focus on teachers, the Tech Jam was a place where teachers came to share their experiences in a classroom for tech companies to work with. Too often, tech creates solutions for education that they think will make a difference without working with the teachers and students who actually use the things they build. Thus, unlike the energy of competition at a hackathon, the Tech Jam was a highly collaborative day of ideation and prototyping.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/GOPR0025-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="DCIM100GOPRO" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/GOPR0025-1.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/GOPR0025-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/GOPR0025-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/GOPR0025-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Teams came up with ideas ranging from a instagram for code to professional development networks between teachers and developers.

I had the opportunity through the UCDC program to take a class on Congress from <a href="https://johnalawrence.wordpress.com/">John Lawrence</a> (Nancy Pelosi’s former chief of staff), which gave me significant context to the things that happened.</p><h3 id="arne-duncan-stepping-down">Arne Duncan Stepping Down</h3><p>One day, the team was called into our meeting room to learn that Arne Duncan would be stepping down at the end of the year. And as a part of the farewell celebrations, stories were told of how much impact Arne’s work has had on public education in his seven years as the Secretary of Education. Even in my short time at the Department, Arne’s vision for education was palpable in the things that my team has worked and will continue to work on.</p><p>And with John King succeeding Arne as the next Secretary of Education, King will be able to pick up on the work in the Department to finish the last year of the administration strong.</p><h3 id="next-gen-high-schools-summit">Next-Gen High Schools Summit</h3><p>The Next-Gen High Schools Summit brought together superintendents, foundations, philanthropists, and students to talk about how to rethink the way that we teach our students. Besides announcing that $375 million in public and private funds would be available for the development of “next-gen” high schools, the summit talked about things from personalized learning, making in the classroom, and more. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/fact_sheet-white_house_summit_on_next-generation_high_schools.pdf">Check out the fact sheet for more</a>.</p><h3 id="every-student-succeeds-act">Every Student Succeeds Act</h3><p>The Every Student Succeeds Act was passed by Congress and signed into law December 10th. This act marks the end of No Child Left Behind, which was an act that mandated standardized testing for student achievement and accountability at a federal level.</p><p>Every Student Succeeds (ESSA) reverts the power back to the states to keep schools accountable, putting the power back into the hands of states, which may end up with mixed results from state to state. However, assessments have become more flexible under ESSA, allowing states to use other forms of assessment beyond standardized testing and allowing for more innovative ways to assess how much students have learned.</p><p>Those are only a few of the changes that will take place as a result of ESSA. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1177/text">Check out the full text for the whole lowdown of bedtime edu-nerd reading</a>.</p><h2 id="lessons-learned-and-perspectives-gained">Lessons Learned and Perspectives Gained</h2><p>For most of my life prior to this experience, being civically minded was not a way that I would describe myself. I was part of the high percentage of millennials who didn’t vote in elections because I didn’t pay enough attention to know what to think. In fact, I was unsure about how much of an impact the government could have on things in my daily life.</p><p>To many people, government is synonymous with slow, inefficient bureaucracies that never get things done. And while there is reason to perceive government as an ugly bureaucracy, I have met some of the smartest people working to make this country a better place. In fact, some of the people I worked with worked harder and longer than Silicon Valley does, while getting compensated significantly less.</p><p>This is because the government’s job is to serve all people. When the power to govern a nation of 330 million people, there is no easy way to make everyone happy. Therefore, unlike the private sector that has the freedom to choose their audience and take big risks, the government needs to make careful decisions and safe bets to maintain a stable foundation for the country.</p><p>This was very evident in my specific experience in education. When it comes to education, west coast technocrats think about education in a different way than the federal government does. The learning-centric approach of the west coast tends to focus on the learner, and attempts to create tools that help students more easily learn. Think about tools from companies like Coursera and Khan Academy, or even the recently founded progressive private schools like AltSchool. The common thread is that these are tools trying to create better learning experiences for students.</p><p>But within the Department of Education, the focus is primarily a systems approach. The question that the Department of Education asks is “how do we use policy to change the way that districts and schools are run?” This puts more of an emphasis on the public school system, that although has it’s fair share of problems, is the best way to implement something at scale and is accessible to all people.</p><p>The equity piece is the biggest differentiator between the two approaches. The public school system has to think about educating students from the bottom up, creating systems that work for everyone while the innovations coming out of Silicon Valley tend to start with small audiences of very select students. Thus, when working in government, your work receives a large amount of visibility by default, which also makes the nature of the work much more big picture.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_20151212_145017.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="IMG_20151212_145017" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/IMG_20151212_145017.jpg 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/IMG_20151212_145017.jpg 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/IMG_20151212_145017.jpg 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_20151212_145017.jpg 2368w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>It was hard to leave on my last day, maybe because something about the nature of an unpaid internship makes you more attached to your work, but I left with a proud sense of knowing that there are incredible people doing incredible work to improve the system within. So to everyone who made my internship awesome, thank you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are my notes in essay form from the Intro to Human Computer Interaction course taught by <a href="http://d.ucsd.edu/srk/">Scott Klemmer</a> at the University of California, San Diego. All credit for content goes to Scott, any errors are my own.</p><p>This final piece of notes compiles content that is not directly related to the process of creating an interface, but are helpful considerations and bonus material that Klemmer taught in class.</p><h2 id="computer-input">Computer Input</h2><p>The most familiar and ubiquitous input device for our devices is the keyboard. Essentially, keyboards are nothing but a matrix of switches that send signals into the computer. But one area of creating interfaces and understanding human computer interaction is to think about the implications of keyboards.</p><p>When looking at the history of computation, it’s no doubt that computing input devices have come a long way. When computers used to take up entire rooms, the punch card was a common method for human input into a computer.</p><p>As computers evolved, the keyboard emerged as the most common input method for computers. Essentially, keyboards are nothing more than a collection of switches. In order to simplify wiring for keyboards, each key is placed on a grid that identifies with a specific row and column. When a key is pressed, the keyboard sends the scan codes into the computer.</p><p>In the history of computers, there has always been an asymmetry of the level of output to the level of input. In other words, the level of detail that computers are able to output is greater than the level of detail that we are able to input.</p><p>One big idea that has begun to shape computation is to put input directly on top of output. For instance, touchscreens allow users to directly manipulate what is on the screen, dramatically reducing the amount of input required.</p><p>Another example of direct manipulation is the mouse. Traditionally, the mouse used a ball that turned two rods in order map the movement of the mouse to the movement of the cursor on the screen. However, in the last decade mice have begun using optical methods and even laser to increase precision and reliability.</p><p>When designing interfaces to be used for the mouse, we want to be aware of how fast users are able to move the mouse and acquire a target. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law">Fitt’s law</a> states that the time it takes to acquire a target is proportional to the distance divided by the target width. Thus, targets that are close and large are going to be faster to acquire than targets that are further and smaller.</p><p>One interface design aimed to decrease the difficulty of acquiring targets is the radial menu. By making targets infinitely large in certain directions, users can simply move their mouse in the direction of the right menu item, making it fast and accurate.</p><p>Just like testing an interface, creating the most efficient design for a particular input type can be measured in a large variety of different ways. Depending on your goals, you may consider to optimize time on task, recall, accuracy, etc. Ultimately, input devices are more than just peripherals. They enable classes of dialogues that fundamentally affect human-computer interaction.</p><h2 id="social-networks">Social Networks</h2><p>Many of the applications that are successful today are ones that have a social component to them. When these applications work, they usually have a large number of users that make the application extraordinarily valuable.</p><p>One strategy for designing good online applications is to begin by studying how people interact offline. This means asking questions like “What makes a great physical communities?”</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Whyte">William Whyte</a>, a famous urban sociologist, created a documentary called “The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces” that explores many of these questions. Essentially, Whyte studied different factors of where people sit, how they interact with public spaces, and more.</p><p>In applying these concepts from physical spaces into digital spaces, there are two main attributes to consider: location and time. These two factors can be used to categorize both physical and digital interactions. For example, when you are speaking to someone else in person, you are both present at the same place and time.</p><p>However, different tools allow us to manipulate these factors, creating different types of experiences. The telephone allows people to interact in different locations at the same time, while leaving post-it notes on someone’s desk allows people to interact in the same location at different times. More often, however, communication tools like email allow us to interact with others in both different places and different times.</p><p>The caveat with different locations and time is that people are not as engaged. Even a video call with participants interacting in different locations at the same time is not as engaging as in person interactions.</p><p>Consider driving as an example. Studies show that when teenagers drive with a passenger, their risk for an accident is lower. This can be attributed to the passenger also being present as another set of eyes to help the driver concentrate. However, when a passenger is present virtually over the phone, the risk for accident increases significantly because passengers are unable to see what is going on around the car.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are my notes in essay form from the Intro to Human Computer Interaction course taught by <a href="http://d.ucsd.edu/srk/">Scott Klemmer</a> at the University of California, San Diego. All credit for content goes to Scott, any errors are my own.</p><p>The next step in the process is to conduct tests on the actual usage of the application. Just like what we saw in the needfinding and interviewing process, simply asking people what they want will lead you to miss a lot of things. Questions like “do you like the interface?” tell you very little about how to improve your product. Even questions that appear to drive more specific results, such as rating the interface on a scale of one to ten, may appear to be more scientific, but is essentially the same question.</p><p>One reason that these questions are relatively unhelpful is because they are not very specific. There is often nothing to compare an interface to when asking that question, leaving the experimenter with a subjective answer.</p><p>There is also what is known as the “please the experimenter bias”, which is the effect of the tester doing their best to please the experimenter, which can be exacerbated when the experimenter is from a different social background, such as when white researchers conducted interviews in foreign countries like India.</p><h2 id="characteristics-of-good-research-questions">Characteristics of Good Research Questions</h2><p>As with user interviews and getting feedback, getting beyond “do you like my interface” means asking questions to that are specific and provide specific insights. Here are a couple characteristics of good questions.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Baserates</strong></strong> – Measuring a baserate generally involves measuring how often something happens, such as how many people click the first link on a search results page.</li><li><strong><strong>Correlations</strong></strong> – Measuring correlations means discovery connections between two separate events, such as measuring the correlation between when a class is offered and how many students attend.</li><li><strong><strong>Causes</strong></strong> – However, with any correlation, be aware that there can be multiple explanations. For whether or not students attend class, the correlation can be a function of when students want to go to class or when good professors want to teach.</li></ul><h2 id="research-terms-to-know">Research Terms to Know</h2><p>To fully understand the way that research is conducted, there are a couple of research terms to be aware of.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Independent variables</strong></strong> are variables that are independent of what the user does, because they are manipulated by the experimenter or application. In the example of the experiment of classes, the independent variable is the time the class is, because that is what the experimenter has control over.</li><li><strong><strong>Dependent variables</strong></strong>, on the other hand, are variables that the user has control of and that the experimenter is trying to measure. Common dependent variables include how long it takes for a user to complete a task, how many errors people make, how much a person remembers after an action, or emotional response.</li><li><strong><strong>Internal validity</strong></strong> determines how reliable an experiment is. If you were to run the experiment again, would you get similar results? Or, if you were to run the experiment with a greater number of people, would the results be similar?</li><li><strong><strong>External validity</strong></strong> is the generalizability of the results. Because internal validity may not apply in a real world situation, external validity determines how easily the results can be applied to other situations.</li></ul><p>One of the common questions that designers want to ask is “is my cool new approach better than the industry standard?” After all, that is the reason why we are building something new. However, the problem with this question is that it is not a fair comparison. The industry standard is likely to have years of development and improvement as well as users that have adapted to the standard, while your product is likely a brand new one without too much development and familiarity. Consequently, asking if your approach is better than the industry standard can generate a response that is attributed to fidelity, approach, or a combination of both.</p><p>For example, one research study that came out when the iPhone was launched seeked to see if the touchscreen keyboard on the iPhone is better than physical qwerty keyboards or numeric keyboards.</p><blockquote>“Research firm User Centric has released a study that tries to gauge how effective the iPhone’s unusual on-screen keyboard is. The goal is certainly a noble one, but I can’t say that the survey’s approach results in data that makes much sense.</blockquote><blockquote>User Centric brought in twenty owners of other phones — half who had ones with QWERTY keyboards, and half who had ordinary numeric phone keypads. None were familiar with the iPhone. The research involved having the test subjects enter six sample text messages with the phones they already had, and six with an iPhone.</blockquote><blockquote>Logical end result: These iPhone newbies took twice as long to enter text with an iPhone as they did with their own phones, and made lots more typos.”</blockquote><p>Let’s break down this study to see why it was not a very good study. In this study, the independent variable, or the manipulation, was the input style. The measure, or metric for comparison, was words per minute.</p><p>In this study, all of the participants were new to iPhone keyboards, making them novices at the iPhone’s new style of keyboard, while being experts at the other type of keyboard they were already used to. While there is nothing wrong with testing beginners to see how fast people can learn a new keyboard, comparing their performance to a keyboard that they are used to is an intrinsically unfair comparison.</p><p>When the study was performed again on participants a month later, they found that iPhone users were about as fast as QWERTY users. This comparison is a more equivalent comparison than the first one.</p><p>However, when looking at the error rate of each type of input device, we find that iPhone users make more errors than the QWERTY or numeric keyboard users. Based on the nature of this study, this result can potentially be traced back to the fact that each keyboard type was used by a different group of users. Thus, there could have been significant differences in who each group of people were, making the variance in the user population still a problematic function if we want to draw conclusions about the overall performance of an input style.</p><h2 id="strategies-for-fair-comparisons">Strategies for Fair Comparisons</h2><p>Now that you’ve seen different ways that comparisons can be unfair, it is easier to recognize that an unfair comparison can lead to skewed results and inaccurate conclusions. Therefore, your job as a researcher is to make comparisons as fair as possible.</p><p>The first strategy for a fairer comparison is to insert your new approach into the actual production setting. By swapping out only the part of the approach that you are trying to change, you can easily see the difference that your approach makes. This may seem challenging, but you can use proxy servers or client side scripting to easily make this work.</p><p>The second strategy for a fairer comparison is to recreate the production approach in your new setting. Similar to the first strategy, this is another way to compare only the parts that you want to change into the production approach.</p><p>Another strategy that is used commonly in research is to scale things down so that you’re just looking at a piece of a larger system. Instead of building the entirety of the program, scaling things down to only the action that your change affects allows you to easily compare the differences.</p><p>Finally, when expertise is relevant, train people up. As we see in the study with the iPhone keyboards, people who were using the iPhone keyboards for the first time unsurprisingly performed worse than people who were using keyboards that they were familiar with.</p><p>The answer to whether interface x is better than interface y is most often “it depends”. Without defining what “better” means, it is impossible to quantitatively compare two interfaces. On the contrary, by properly understanding these characteristics of experiments, it allows you to make more accurate conclusions on the data that you collect.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/correlation.png" class="kg-image" alt></figure><h2 id="in-person-experiments">In Person Experiments</h2><p>While the web has made running experiments online extremely easy, there are also many benefits that come with watching people in person. By watching people live, you can talk to them about what they’re doing, hear their feedback, see points of confusion, and in general have a higher bandwidth of engagement.</p><p>When planning an in person experiment, the first step is to make clear goals and lay out the scope of the experiment, which will be guided by the purpose of the experiment, or what you hope to learn.</p><p>For example, if you’re building a room reservation system for a computer science department, one strategy would be to put all the information on one page, while another strategy may be putting information on multiple pages. You might be interested in seeing if splitting things up increases the likelihood of booking a room or not.</p><p>To conduct this experiment, we must consider a couple of factors. First, identify an appropriate setting for testing. If your software is most likely to be used in a quiet room, find a quiet room to do your testing. If your software is most likely to be used at a train station, conduct your experiment at a train station.</p><p>Next, figure out who you’re going to recruit, how, and how many people. Come up with realistic scenarios, ideally ones that participants can care about, to give people when they come in.</p><p>When it comes time for people to come in to test your product, have a list of questions and things that you want to pay attention to. In the case of our example, questions may include “Will people book the right sized room? For the right length of time?” or “How long did it take for the participant to book the room?” or “What other actions do people do while booking a room?”</p><p>If you can, it is helpful to have at least two experimenters present for the test. One person will be in charge of facilitating while the other takes notes.</p><p>During in person experiments, it is important to create concrete tasks for people to do, so that you have concrete data to compare, and everyone gets the same experience. In our example, a concrete task prompt might look something like:</p><blockquote>“Book a room sometime next week for a research group meeting. Andrew will be out of town, so we won’t hear his weekly update. The rest of us should be present and give our updates. Besides the usual group members, we’ll have two visitors from France who will present their research — maybe they’ll take ten minutes each. When you’re done booking the room, tell Arvind so he can prepare the next task for you.”</blockquote><p>As a side note, something to consider when performing in person experiments are ethical considerations. Some experiments have left participants in tears when they were unable to perform well. For starters, make consent voluntary, and make sure consent is informed, and allow participants to stop the study whenever they want. Perhaps the biggest clarification is to inform the user that you are testing the site, not the users. This helps users to understand that mistakes are the fault of the system instead of their own.</p><p>Another tip to create better experiments is to pilot your experimenting, letting one or two people go through the experiment before bringing in larger amounts of participants. This will help you work out any kinks in the flow of the experiment, the order of the experiment, and any other cases that may arise.</p><p>To best capture results from your experiment, the most simple and direct way is to take notes of things that went well, questions that arose, or problems to fix, one option is to record video. Be sure to collect both qualitative process data such as observations of what users are thinking and doing, as well as bottom-line quantitative data such as how many people succeed, how long it takes, etc.</p><p>Going beyond simple note taking, you may choose to record video. Recording video allows you to document and easily share exactly how and what the user felt as they go through the process.</p><p>Another consideration to capturing results is to determine whether you want participants to think aloud while they are going through the process. This allows you to record what the users are thinking, not just what they are doing. Since most people may not be used to sharing their thoughts out loud, you may need to prompt users along the way. Be aware that thinking out loud may also cause users behavior’s to change, and may not be an exact representation of what the user is thinking.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, it is helpful to debrief the participant so that they know what your goals were and so that you can learn more holistically what they are thinking after the experiment.</p><h2 id="online-experiments">Online Experiments</h2><p>The web has enabled tremendous power to conduct experiments online. This is accomplished by rolling out different versions of the user interface, getting feedback, and iterating quickly. You may have heard of this under many different names, likely A/B testing, split testing, randomized experiments, etc. The basic premise for this kind of testing is to randomly split traffic on your website to two or more versions of your interface, and then collect data on how the two versions perform.</p><p>As an example, the following are pages for the national alert registry, with three versions laid out below. The third interface, a two column layout, was designed to see whether it would generate more sign ups because the content is available above the fold.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.14.10.png" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot 2015-04-03 20.14.10" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.14.10.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.14.10.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.14.10.png 1600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.14.10.png 2144w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Before scrolling down to see the results, think about which version of these three user interfaces you think was the most effective.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.13.37.png" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot 2015-04-03 20.13.37" srcset="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.13.37.png 600w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.13.37.png 1000w, https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2015-04-03-20.13.37.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What you can see from the data is that the third version actually performed worse than the first two. Although it was intended to be more effective, the number of sales actually dropped tremendously. Even the very best designers often make a revision that performs worse than the original. The web allows us to easily try out these designs and get real feedback on how the designs perform.</p><p>So why did the third version do so much worse? One theory is the word free at the top left of the screen, that can dissuade people from buying something. Another theory is that by creating two columns, there is less of a clear flow, creating a perception of multiple options instead of a clear funnel that you want people to go through. By contrast, the second version did not have the word free at the top, and had a stronger call to action.</p><p>Therefore, we can see from this example that small changes can have a big effect on the performance of a site. These changes can include things like the position and color of the primary call to action, position of testimonials on the page, whether linked elements are in text or images, the amount of white space on a page, the position and prominence of the main heading, the number of columns on the page, number of visual elements competing for attention, the age, sex, and appearance of someone in a photo, etc. See the <a href="http://diplateevo.com/intro-to-hci-lecture-5-visual-design/">visual design</a> lecture for more details on how to create good visual design.</p><p>Another example is Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008. Dan Siroker of the Obama campaign, shares how he used simple A/B tests on the button as well as the media to increase the performance of the Obama’s campaign site.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/71bH8z6iqSc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In the experiment with the text on the buttons, the only thing that changed between versions is the text on the button. The four choices were “Sign Up”, “Learn More”, “Join Us Now”, and “Sign Up Now”. Turns out, “Learn More” performed 18% better than the baseline.</p><p>The second experiment, the media on the page, was split between three photos and three videos. The strongest media, contrary to what most people would have guessed, was the family photo.</p><p>From these examples, there are a couple of general principles that contribute to a quality online experiments.</p><p>Firstly, when running online experiments, it is most helpful to run experiments at 50/50%. While some people recommend starting a small percentage of users with the new design, this is not as helpful for being able to quickly tell which interface performs better. By setting it at 50/50, the better interface is blatantly apparent. However, to prevent disastrous results, ramping up to 50% is the best course of action. Ramping up will help avoid software bugs or other unforeseen effects affecting users from performing the task.</p><p>There are some key rules for random assignment. The first is that your assignment should be consistent. The same person should see the same interface every single time they use your interface. The second key rule is that your assignment should be truly and completely random. This means that you want to run different versions simultaneously, and that the probability someone has of using one version of the interface is the same as using the another version.</p><p>The hardest part about online experimentation is picking the metric to measure a good interface by. One common mistake when picking metrics is picking a metric that is easy to measure instead of a metric that accurately reflects success. Thus, it is important to pick a metric that matters over picking a metric that is easy to measure.</p><p>Additionally, it is also important to run online experiments for long enough. Just like users testing the new iPhone keyboard, if you change a user interface, people may not be used to it, generating poorer initial results.</p><p>Finally, no matter how long or diligently you conduct your experiments, larger theories are still difficult to prove. Even with large sets of data, the variance and changes can be due to a larger, unseen reason. Thus, it is important to constantly ask different questions and run multiple types of experiments to identify trends on how interfaces perform rather than all encompassing claims one way or the other.</p><h2 id="interpreting-test-results">Interpreting Test Results</h2><p>After you’ve done your tests, whether in person or online, it is important to properly analyze the data so that you reach accurate conclusions. A good starting point is asking yourself the questions “What does my data look like?”, “What are the overall numbers?” and “Are the differences real?”</p><p>For instance, say I have a coin and I want to test to see whether the coin is a fair coin or not. To test the coin for fairness, let’s say that I flip it 20 times and 13 of the flips came up heads. Despite the fact that the result of 13 heads is not equal to the expected number of heads, we need to determine if 3 additional heads out of 20 is a significant difference.</p><p>Since the results of flipping a coin lies on a gaussian distribution, that is that the further away the outcome is from the mean, the less likely it is to occur, we know that flipping 11 heads on a fair coin out of 20 flips is more likely than flipping 19 heads out of 20 flips.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/fig11-10.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="fig11-10"></figure><p>To determine the significance of the difference, we are going to use the Pearson’s Chi-Squared Test (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test</a>). This test is a way to compare the expected rates to the experimental rates to determine a percentage of confidence toward a conclusion.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/latex.png" class="kg-image" alt="x^{2} = \frac{(observed - expected)^{2}}{expected}" title="x^{2} = \frac{(observed - expected)^{2}}{expected}"></figure><p>To accurately determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis, or the default hypothesis that the coin is a fair coin, we need a threshold p-value, most often 0.05, to compare with the result of the chi-squared test.</p><p>Therefore, if 20 flips of a coin resulted in 13 heads and we have a p-value less than 0.05, we have:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/latex--1-.png" class="kg-image" alt="\frac{(13 - 10)^{2}}{10} + \frac{(7 - 10)^{2}}{10} = 1.8 " title="\frac{(13 - 10)^{2}}{10} + \frac{(7 - 10)^{2}}{10} = 1.8 "></figure><p>(heads + tails = chi-squared value)</p><p>Based on our calculation and the <a href="http://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/chidistribution.aspx">p-value distribution table</a>, we can see that our results are not quite at the p &lt; 0.05 threshold, meaning that we cannot sufficiently reject our null hypothesis and say that the coin is biased.</p><p>However, if we flipped the coin 60 times and resulted in 39 heads, the same ratio as the previous experiment, running those numbers through the chi-squared distribution allows us to reject the null hypothesis with 98% certainty. This is because more trials brings our chi-squared value up.</p><p>Chi-Squared testing is valuable because it doesn’t just apply to coins, but also applies to click through rates on websites. Let’s say that a website has a button labeled “sign up”, and 10% of visitors click the button. To try to improve traffic, designers change the button to “learn more”, and start gathering data. Over a week, there were 1000 visitors to the site, 118 of which clicked the “learn more” button. Running this data through the formula gives us the follow chi-squared value:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.diplateevo.com/content/images/2021/01/latex--2-.png" class="kg-image" alt="\frac{(118 - 100)^{2}}{100} + \frac{(882 - 900)^{2}}{900} = 4.01 " title="\frac{(118 - 100)^{2}}{100} + \frac{(882 - 900)^{2}}{900} = 4.01 "></figure><p>In looking up this data in <a href="http://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/chidistribution.aspx">our table</a>, we find that 4.01 generates a p-value that is just smaller than 0.05, allowing us to formally say that the change was an improvement.</p><p>Thus, statistical testing gives you two very powerful tools. First, it allows you to formalize “we’re pretty sure”, using statistics to validate your claim. Secondly, it helps you generalize (or not) from small sample sizes. There are also other tests that achieve a similar purpose for continuous data such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test">T-tests</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance">ANOVA</a>.</p><p>Also, note that data often isn’t “normal”. Data doesn’t always lie on a gaussian distribution, as it can be bimodal or weighted one way, making statistical analysis potential complex.</p><h2 id="further-reading-and-resources">Further Reading and Resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/hcic-11.pdf">Practical Statistics for HCI – Jacob Wobbrock</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0495115770/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0495115770&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=diplateevo-20&amp;linkId=I66BIBQDKUFJCBKA">Doing Psychology Experiments – David W Martin</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805805281/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0805805281&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=diplateevo-20&amp;linkId=YEHNHW7DK43YYWRL">Statistics as Principled Argument – Robert P.
