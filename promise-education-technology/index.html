For a long time education and technology have been separate disciplines, but as technology is increasingly incorporated into every area of our lives, education also increasingly incorporates technology.</p> <h2 lang=en> How We Got Here</h2> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> In the spirit of getting teaching and learning into the digital era, we’ve tried many different ideas to make education more digital. <a class=svelte-bu32sq href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>2012 was the year of the Massive Open Online Courses</a> (also known as MOOCs), and promises to make learning, faster, cheaper, and better scaled to students everywhere. The result? Teachers recording lectures the same way they would give them in a classroom, putting them online, resulting in completion rates of about 15%.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> In 2013, LA unified school district <a class=svelte-bu32sq href=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ipad-curriculum-refund-20150415-story.html rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>planned to spend $1.3 billion on iPads</a>, only to turn around on cold feet after realizing that the software and infrastructure wasn’t what they thought they signed up for.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Despite these failures, there are also many instances of technology having a significant positive impact on education. Students all over the country are using technology in their education, in everything from research to video projects to computer science.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Albemarle County Schools in Charlottesville Virginia is one example among many pockets of primary and secondary schools that <a class=svelte-bu32sq href=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-02-albemarle-county-schools-journey-from-a-makerspace-to-a-maker-district rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>have received national acclaim for the success of their makerspaces</a>, inspiring many of their K12 students to use creative technological mediums to share what they’ve learned.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> And through the <a class=svelte-bu32sq href=https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/connected rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>ConnectEd initiative of the Obama administration</a>, more schools in the US are providing internet access to their students than ever before, helping students to prepare themselves to work with the digital tools that are ubiquitous today.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> But as the <a class=svelte-bu32sq href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/asian-nations-dominate-international-test-100159386.html?ref=gs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>test scores of our nation has fallen far behind</a> those of China, Singapore, Japan, Korea, and Finland, people are justified in pointing out that our efforts with education technology have not given us the results that our technology had promised.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Technology was supposed to improve education by making it higher quality, more accessible, and more affordable. But while technology has improved education for some, it hasn’t been as successful as we’ve been hoping for as a nation.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> <strong> <strong>What happened? Wasn’t technology supposed to come in as the grand superhero and solve all of our problems as it did for so many other sectors? As a Silicon Valley native, I wondered: what would it take for technology to disrupt education?</strong></strong></p> <h2 lang=en> Down the Rabbit Hole</h2> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Pondering this point for myself, I went on a journey to learn as much as I could about our education system, venturing far outside the perimeter of the technology sector.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Remember that conversation about hackathons we had? In September of 2015, my friend became an intern at the White House and I started interning at the US Department of Education.

tech companies, teachers, and students, all voices were critical in creating something that would truly be effective. It was in that moment that I had a key realization about education.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> John King, the current secretary of education, in a closing address at the tech jam that we hosted, spoke about the importance of bringing all stakeholders into the conversation.</p> <blockquote class="md svelte-1ru6a47" lang=en> “I was encouraged by the level of listening that was taking place. As I visit schools around the country, too often you see technology tools that might have made a difference in theory, but aren’t actually working for kids in the classroom.” – John King</blockquote> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> That day showed me that it was the dialogue between students, educators, and developers that become powerful ideas for education. When we come to the table willing to listen and understand, we are able to personally invest ourselves in a mission that isn’t just about us, but about fundamentally adding value to the people we are serving.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> But what does this have to do with technology?</p> <h2 lang=en> The Conversations in Edtech</h2> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The legend of Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs himself tried many things to improve education with technology.</p> <blockquote class="md svelte-1ru6a47" lang=en> “I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.” – Steve Jobs</blockquote> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The three months I spent at the department of education gave me a bigger picture of the incredibly diverse set of issues that our education system in the United States faces that is unique to our own country. Not only do we have students of every single racial and cultural identity, we have to address different languages, social norms, and expectations.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Steve Jobs was correct given his assumption of education, but his assumption was fundamentally flawed: He approached education technology as a charitable donation that he hoped would automatically improve teaching and learning. But simply giving a student a computer doesn’t mean that their grammar is going to automatically improve.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> <strong> <strong>Contrary to the ethos of Silicon Valley, education can’t be disrupted with a single solution.</strong></strong> With so many different stakeholders in such complicated dynamics, getting technology implemented in education isn’t about companies developing and pushing their ideas, but about the conversations with everyone involved: students, teachers, administrators, developers, and more.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> It’s about understanding the problems and utilizing technology only when it is the best tool for the problem. With so many diverse problems in our education system, improving education with technology starts with understanding the types of problems students face on a regular basis. Too often we forget to consider how our decisions impact students of lower socioeconomic statuses, minorities, and other marginalized students.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> In contrast to Steve Job’s statement of using technology in teaching and learning, former secretary of education Arne Duncan framed it in the context of technological access.</p> <blockquote class="md svelte-1ru6a47" lang=en> “I worry that technology is not being implemented fast enough. Technology has the ability to improve equity in our public schools, or the ability to exacerbate current equity gaps.” – Arne Duncan</blockquote> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Trying to unify the two perspectives led me to my next question: Given that we can’t make assumptions about the solutions that students need, what are the problems that all students, especially disenfranchised students, struggle with on a regular basis?</p> <h2 lang=en> Listening to Students</h2> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> To answer this question, I turned to the tools I know best: web programming. I started thinking about technology in a different way; not just technology as a potential to augment teaching and learning, but as a means of civic engagement and empowerment.</p> <div class="svelte-1f31tvi image-wrap"><picture class=svelte-1f31tvi><source media="(max-width: 480px) and (max-resolution: 1dppx)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@480w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@768w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@1024w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@1400w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1920px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@1920w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 480px) and (max-resolution: 1dppx)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@480w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@768w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@1024w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@1400w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1920px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132@1920w.jpg type=image/jpeg> <img alt="Screenshot 2016-07-30 15.36.13(2)" class=svelte-1f31tvi loading=lazy src=/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2016-07-30-15.36.132.jpg title="" width=1920></picture> </div> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> With a student run nonprofit named Student Voice, I got together with a group of friends and put together <a class=svelte-bu32sq href=http://www.sturights.org/ rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>the Student Bill of Rights</a>, a collection of 12 rights covering everything from free expression to health and well being to technology.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Then, in order to allow students to share what matters most to them, I built a voting platform around the 12 rights and allowed students to vote on the three rights most important to them.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Here is what we found: Of over 1000 students who voted, the most voted on right was free expression, followed by fair assessment, and personal learning.

How can I get some of this general fund?”</blockquote> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> This next story, from a refugee student belonging to a group where students openly share stories, showed me the importance of allowing students to freely express themselves before they can be comfortable in their classrooms.</p> <div class="svelte-1f31tvi image-wrap"><picture class=svelte-1f31tvi><source media="(max-width: 480px) and (max-resolution: 1dppx)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@480w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@768w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@1024w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@1400w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 1920px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@1920w.webp type=image/webp><source media="(max-width: 480px) and (max-resolution: 1dppx)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@480w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@768w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@1024w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@1400w.jpg type=image/jpeg><source media="(max-width: 1920px)" srcset=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1@1920w.jpg type=image/jpeg> <img alt="13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o (1)" class=svelte-1f31tvi loading=lazy src=/content/images/2020/12/13072847_1014674201915564_4126103254650009150_o-1.jpg title="" width=2048></picture> </div> <blockquote class="md svelte-1ru6a47" lang=en> “…After my dad died I was so depressed. I could never leave my house. I could never talk to anybody. But when my mom said let’s go on vacation I was feeling like sure. So we went but then when I saw the border I was like wait where are we. After that my mom said we were going to the US and I was like, “What? You never told me that! You never told me anything!” And I start crying more and more and more. I hated my mom for those fifteen days because she never really told me what was going to happen but at the same time I feel happy because if she would’ve told me, I would never have come with her. I got here legally. One of the happiest things when I got here was that I got to meet my uncles and my grandpa. Those people were never in my life before but now they really help me out.”</blockquote> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> These are only a few of the many incredibly personal stories that we’ve collected and shared through our online platforms. And hopefully by getting a small glimpse of what students go through on a regular basis, you’ve come to a similar conclusion that I did: Maybe we’ve been looking at education technology wrong this whole time.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Technology shouldn’t be a sterile, programmatic medium for students to standardize their learning. It needs to be a tool that allows them to further express their creativity and emotions in a safe way. I don’t see the journey of education as a deterministic computation, I see it as a beautiful mess of emotions, struggles, and community.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Students are people full of ideas, emotions, problems, character, nuance, culture, ambitions, and thoughts. Students spill out in ways that don’t fit within conventional boundaries. Just look at student organized movements like the Vietnam war protests, demonstrations against genocides overseas, civil rights and black lives matter – students have always been at the forefront of taking action to be the change they want to see in the world.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> I’m not saying that protests are the only way to improve education, but we do need to be heard. Education is not the responsibility of the government, nor is it the responsibility of the teacher. It is the responsibility of the whole community: students, teachers, parents, and educators to dialogue about the things we can do to improve our schools, our country, and the world.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> The ways that students have organized looks vastly different from generation to generation, and as our generation sets the example for what it means to bring equity and equality in our technological age, I hope that you are as proud as I am to be a student attending school in America today.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> As students, we are all inadvertently part of a dialogue that transcends our education systems, whether we are aware of it or not. It is through this dialogue that we have the choice to empower or silence the voices of the students around us. It may be hard to believe that your voice matters in the big picture of education, and that’s how I felt before organizing the White House Tech Jam.</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> Education has a long way to go before we solve the problems of quality, equity, affordability, and accessibility. And whether we achieve those solutions through technology or otherwise, it begins with students like us participating in this dialogue. How will you participate in this dialogue?</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> I’m going to leave you with a confession:</p> <p class=svelte-wrcfx4 lang=en> I started this journey thinking it would be about technology, but it’s not about the technology; it’s about the student.</p> <div class="svelte-1lak9hx grid-horizontal-rule"></div> </div></div></div></div></div>
