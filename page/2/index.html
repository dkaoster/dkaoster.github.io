Some experiments have left participants in tears when they were unable to perform well. For starters, make consent voluntary, and make sure consent is informed, and allow participants to stop the study whenever they want. Perhaps the biggest clarification is to inform the user that you are testing the site, not the users. This helps users to understand that mistakes are the fault of the system instead of their own.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Another tip to create better experiments is to pilot your experimenting, letting one or two people go through the experiment before bringing in larger amounts of participants.

This is accomplished by rolling out different versions of the user interface, getting feedback, and iterating quickly. You may have heard of this under many different names, likely A\u002FB testing, split testing, randomized experiments, etc. The basic premise for this kind of testing is to randomly split traffic on your website to two or more versions of your interface, and then collect data on how the two versions perform.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"As an example, the following are pages for the national alert registry, with three versions laid out below. The third interface, a two column layout, was designed to see whether it would generate more sign ups because the content is available above the fold.\"]]],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Before scrolling down to see the results, think about which version of these three user interfaces you think was the most effective.\"]]],[10,2],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"What you can see from the data is that the third version actually performed worse than the first two. Although it was intended to be more effective, the number of sales actually dropped tremendously. Even the very best designers often make a revision that performs worse than the original. The web allows us to easily try out these designs and get real feedback on how the designs perform.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"So why did the third version do so much worse? One theory is the word free at the top left of the screen, that can dissuade people from buying something. Another theory is that by creating two columns, there is less of a clear flow, creating a perception of multiple options instead of a clear funnel that you want people to go through. By contrast, the second version did not have the word free at the top, and had a stronger call to action.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Therefore, we can see from this example that small changes can have a big effect on the performance of a site. These changes can include things like the position and color of the primary call to action, position of testimonials on the page, whether linked elements are in text or images, the amount of white space on a page, the position and prominence of the main heading, the number of columns on the page, number of visual elements competing for attention, the age, sex, and appearance of someone in a photo, etc. See the \"],[0,[2],1,\"visual design\"],[0,[],0,\" lecture for more details on how to create good visual design.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Another example is Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008.

While some people recommend starting a small percentage of users with the new design, this is not as helpful for being able to quickly tell which interface performs better. By setting it at 50\u002F50, the better interface is blatantly apparent. However, to prevent disastrous results, ramping up to 50% is the best course of action. Ramping up will help avoid software bugs or other unforeseen effects affecting users from performing the task.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"There are some key rules for random assignment. The first is that your assignment should be consistent. The same person should see the same interface every single time they use your interface. The second key rule is that your assignment should be truly and completely random. This means that you want to run different versions simultaneously, and that the probability someone has of using one version of the interface is the same as using the another version.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The hardest part about online experimentation is picking the metric to measure a good interface by. One common mistake when picking metrics is picking a metric that is easy to measure instead of a metric that accurately reflects success. Thus, it is important to pick a metric that matters over picking a metric that is easy to measure.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Additionally, it is also important to run online experiments for long enough. Just like users testing the new iPhone keyboard, if you change a user interface, people may not be used to it, generating poorer initial results.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Finally, no matter how long or diligently you conduct your experiments, larger theories are still difficult to prove. Even with large sets of data, the variance and changes can be due to a larger, unseen reason.

Let’s say that a website has a button labeled “sign up”, and 10% of visitors click the button. To try to improve traffic, designers change the button to “learn more”, and start gathering data.
